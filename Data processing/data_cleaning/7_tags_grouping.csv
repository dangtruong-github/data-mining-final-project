62,"After her parents die, Adelaine Scott and her three younger siblings are forced to go live with their abusive uncle. As each day passes, Lainey will do anything she can to protect her brothers and sister, even if it means putting herself in harm's way.  But what she didn't count on was bumping into the sexy football player who seems to have a keen interest in her. 
    
    Nathan O'Conner is the stereotypical popular boy. As star quarterback with a rich family, everyone wants to be his friend, but he only wants one girl. The shy, new girl that wants nothing to do with him. He feels protective over her, but doesn't know why; all he wants is for her to give him a chance.   
    
    What happens when Adelaine's abuse gets worse and Nathan starts to notice? Will he be able to save her and her siblings, or will Lainey's complicated life tear their relationship apart?
    
    This story is fast paced and full of drama! It has teenagers that had to become adults too fast and shows the importance of family. The story contains some language and abuse but no sexual content.

    Update: The beginning of the story isn't my best work, but I promise it gets better. Bare with me and you will see how my writing style changes a bit during the book; I'm just too lazy to go back and rewrite the first couple chapters ;) ENJOY!

    Oliver Green is smart. With a dream of becoming a successful doctor, Oliver is always studying in hopes of attending Harvard medical school one day. A regular volunteer at the local animal shelter and a busy tutoring schedule keeps him busy. 
    Benjamin Jones is an athlete. As captain and quarterback of the Eastside High School football team, he is well known as the 'it' boy of the school. Ben didn't think much of school, football was his entire life and all he could see himself doing in the future was playing at a D1 school before being drafted into the NFL.
    When Ben is in danger of being kicked off of the football team due to his slipping biology grade, Oliver is asked to tutor him. The unlikely pair get off to a rocky start, but as the two get to know one another, they find themselves never wanting tutoring to end.

The only difference was: Jian Qiaoxin is holding a phone, but Yan Gan is holding a knife. 

Therefore. 

The scene of catching an adultery turned into a bloodbath scene; he was supposed to come here to confront his boyfriend of the cheating, now he became the one trying to mediate the situation. 

""Chairman Yan, please calm down, put down your knife and spare his life. I can see that he knows he is wrong now."" 

After breaking up with his boyfriend, Jian Qiao Xin went drinking his sorrows away; it also happened that Yan Gan also came drinking at the same club. A drunken Jian Quaoxin and Yan Gan shared the same bed that night. 

The next morning, Jian Qiaoxin woke up with Chairman Yan sleeping right next to him; recalling the night that Yan Gan raised the knife at the adulterous couple, he quickly ran out of the room to save his own life. 

A few months later, Jian Qiaoxin's crazy morning sickness routines had caught his manager's attention: ""Fuck, you think the big boss will let you off, you dare getting pregnant during this time of your career?"" 

Jian Qiaoxin: ""...""

Kill me then, after all this is his deed.

    Yue Fei transmigrates into a novel and becomes the fodder beta male partner of the male lead in the book. His alpha boyfriend marks an omega because he is being led on by the pheromone...

    However, Yue Fei, who transmigrated into the novel, yawned: I don't bother to give these two people a glance. 
    
    The family wanted Yue Fei to marry into the rich, because the other party's first choice was beta. In the original work, Yue Fei, who should do everything possible to escape the marriage and vilify the other party, nodded after listening to the introduction of the middleman: Yes, I'll get married. 
    
    Big Shot Gu Wei: I like smart and tactful people. 
    
    Yu Fei's true thoughts: Marrying into a wealthy family, I don't have to worry about money and just live my life lavishly forever, why not agree?

    It happened on the day her father died.
    
    It was meant to be a solemn day, a day to say goodbye, a day to reminisce the past and smile about fond memories - but it became the day she first experienced his ruthlessness. They were attacked by gunmen in black vans. The shootout destroyed a lot but she scaled through the ordeal unscathed.
    
    No sooner had they recovered from the shooting than she got a phone call from the Mafia himself. He told her with his gruff voice that made shivers run through her that he had taken her father's corpse. He knew, he just knew how much she loved her father, dead or alive. He knew how miserable it would make her not to be able to say goodbye.
    
    He agreed to release the corpse in exchange for something. And what was it he wanted in exchange? None other than her, Pamela King.

""Listen May"" Ace said with a pleading voice.
""No Ace! You listen, I was not the one who ended our relationship! I was not the one who decided it would be better to sleep with a new girl every night instead of coming home to a loving girlfriend! It was not me who messed up Ace! It was you!"" At this point I had tears running down my cheeks.

Ace Rossi
Known around the world as the biggest Mafia man. Said to have the coldest heart and kill without blinking. What the world does not know is that Ace had a girlfriend, May, for 3 years. He was his light, his angle from heaven, but he dumped her for freedom. And that was, and still is his biggest regret. So after 2 months without the love of his life he begins to look for her, it took him 10 months, but he found her! And 2 other people as well?

May De Le√≥n
Known around the world by anyone who has ever picked up a medical textbook. At the age of 17 she has already completed her medical residency and was hired as a neurological surgeon in Italy. That's when she met Ace, they were friends at first but on her 18th birthday he asked her out, obviously she said yes. 3 years later he dumps her. And so she leaves. After leaving Italy, May travels to the country side of Scotland. When she gets there she meets 2 little boys, Theigo (Theo) and Roman. Both of them were orphans, so after 6 months with them, May decided to adopt them both. A well respected neuro surgeon, a healthy life style, and a mother of 2. What more could May want in life?!

Will Ace earn back Mays trust and heart? Or will she realize that he is not worth fighting for?

    Excerpt:
    
    I looked up and stared. My reflection looked back at me in the mirror of the dark room. My eyes were literally glowing, there was no mistaking it. It was not a reflection of light, or any of the other excuses I had used or others had assumed. They were glowing a light sapphire blue color. It was not a bright glow, but it was definitely a glow.
    
    Glowing eyes were not normal.
    Okay, at this point I had to admit it, I was no longer normal.
    What was I then? For that, I had no answer

    Reyna Fields seems to be an ordinary girl with her thick-framed glasses, baggy clothes, hair always up in a ponytail, and her head tucked away behind a computer screen. However,  no one knows she's armed with a genius IQ and a heart of gold. She hacks her way into virtual systems on a search for her mother. 
    
    Unfortunately for her, she has hacked into the wrong database. She hacked into the database of the notorious mob boss, Santino ""Saint"" Venturi.
    
    Saint is the opposite of his name. He's known for his ruthlessness. As a mob boss to a mafia, he learned to eat or be eaten. When Reyna stumbles upon his database, a plan dispersed into his mind. He's going to take her.

    His fingers trailed up her leg before his hand latched onto her sex. He held her there while a small gasp left her lips. ""I will fuck you on this table if he doesn't stop looking at what belongs to me.""

    Aaron's special power might just be the coolest- or scariest- thing ever! It's always helped with his bad-boy reputation, his rightfully arrogant all-knowing intimidation seemed to go a long way with his love life and somehow also his education.
    
    Until he met Violet, one of the smartest girls in school; a girl he's been using for years, zoning in on her mind to ultimately cheat on exams and steal the title of valedictorian. Until one day, Violet failed him. Her mind wandered all over the place- her parent's divorce, her breakup, and he couldn't help but sympathize. But Violet's a smart girl, who knows how long it'll take before she finds out.
    
    Aaron depends so much on his mind-reading capabilities that when they suddenly disappear- so does everything he hasn't worked for. His secret was like Samson and his hair, once it's told, the magic's all gone.

112,"The world had gone to hell long ago, taken over by the vampire race. In order to keep some sort of peace in our land, the Vampire Lords made a consecutive agreement. The rich and powerful humans could survive just as they had been, untouched by the vampires save for the occasional blood collections, or so they thought 
    
    In reality, we were all under their control. Castles spread out throughout our land, one landing in each city. Each castle varied in the number of vampires residing there, but all of them carried a Lord. The Lords were the ones in charge in every city, whether we liked it or not. The vampires often roam through the city, making sure that everyone was in order and no one stepped out of line. If you stepped out of line, you died, end of story. 
    
    Even if the rich were still under their control, their lives were still better than the poor. 
    
    The poorest lives held a much worse fate. 
    
    The men were to be put to work as slaves, whether that meant serving a specific vampire, or just building their castles, they were slaves. The women were to be pets.
    
    Pets were the lowest rank you could have. They were forced into cages that were too small to stand in with collars around their necks. They spent their lives in pet shops, just waiting for the dreadful day that they'll be bought. They were treated like animals, trained into what their master wanted, and punished if they misbehaved. Those who were lucky enough to live through that, we're to be slaughtered for their blood at age twenty-five in an act to make sure that our population would stay steady. 
    
    I was born into this world. Born into this world full of blood-sucking monsters. Except, I was one of the lucky ones.
    
    Was.
    
    It all ended for me when I was 12, when I was taken away from the last bit of hope and family that I had left. Ever since then, I've lived in a cage, just rotting away, waiting, dreading for the day that some monster would make me his.
    
    This is my life. I am a pet.

One day, your computer broke down at the middle of your online class session and decided to open Genshin Impact.

    Adalina Romano is tired of being manipulated by the men in her life. After her greedy uncle drags her halfway across the world to barter her in a deal between him and the heir to Sicily's largest mafia, the Cosa Nostra, she finds herself married to a man who makes her uncle look like a saint. She shouldn't be attracted to Vincent Salvatore, but Adalina cannot avoid his unforgiving stare nor deny the electrical charge she feels whenever they touch. Vincent sees Adalina as an obstacle in his fight for power, but soon has no choice but to keep her safe when they're caught in a war of dominance and greed. As Vincent's walls begin to slip, Adalina discovers a spark of light in his darkness, and once she's had a taste, she only wants more. When their spark turns into a fire, protecting Adalina amid one of the biggest mafia deals of Vincent's life means going against everything he's ever known, consequences be damned.

    Consumed by avarice, the four human kingdoms-the Infernal Empire, the Kingdom of Caelum, the Kingdom of Treterra, and the Nayale Archipelago-betrayed their covenant with Yther of Azitera, the race blessed by deities, who protected humans for untold centuries. They slaughtered and defiled the beings that once protected them from storm, famine, poverty, and pestilence without mercy. 
    
    Betrayed by the humans they protected, the Ytherians were enslaved. Their four queens were caged, chained, and imprisoned to serve as nutrients to the human kingdoms. The once prominent Ytherians were reduced to nothing but servants.
    
    As the four kingdoms of the human race prospered for many years since their betrayal, one news staggered them, causing them to tremble in fear and rally their armies to protect and defend their domain: Sollel-the Mistress of Flame, one of Yther's queens-had escaped her prison. Her flames will raze hell, ready to burn the souls of her betrayers.

    This is a love story.  Hot boys like Luke Dawson never pay attention to nobodies like Millie.

When opposite attract, the spontaneous reaction can be a combustion or a downright explosion.  With Luke, my money's on the explosion.

    Aubrey Whitlock's life is turned upside down after her divorce, leaving her an unemployed, broke, and single 29-year-old. A chance meeting with her ex throws her for a loop again when he makes her an offer: come work with him as his assistant. Now a self-made billionaire, Bryce Roberts is just as infuriating-and good-looking-as he was the first time around.

    That is until he meets the 'nerds' of the university, or better way to put it, the wolves in disguise.

    Especially Taehyung.
    
    Taehyung wants the protect them, falling for their timid and impotent persona.
    
    Meanwhile they want him as their little doll, believing he's just like any regular kid with impeccable beauty.

    ""You know what they say,"" Jungkook tusks, fixing his glasses on his face, ""Don't judge a book by its cover doll.""

279,"Debra doesn't need anyone to tell her that going from one relationship straight into another is never a good idea. Despite knowing this, she finds herself staring at a certain Marine with the body of a demigod and all covered in tattoos. 
    
    Retired Marine, Trystan Debney, has seen and experienced his fair share of the bad and ugly. His physical and emotional scars are a testament to that. Even with the great support from his family and an inspiring new career, he feels unfulfilled. That is until he meets Debra Ames. 
    
    She is everything he ever wanted in a woman, except for the fact that she wants nothing to do with him or relationships in general. She wants to learn how to be single and he wants a wife. Furthermore, she refuses to give him more than her body, not knowing that is all he needs to get to her heart.
    
    And once he has her heart, there's nothing he wouldn't do to keep her safe and far away from his enemies.

you are min sora, who is born to be marked by a cursed vampire and to lend him a hand, even if it might cost your life to be menaced. 

it was hard to swallow but eventually you did realize that no one could go against the rules. with nothing better to do in your aimless life, you give in to fill the void.

    A princess.
      
      
      The first thing that come to your mind when you think of a princess is someone with the perfect life and a loving family.
      
      
      But, there are always exceptions. An example being Analise Royal, the youngest daughter of the king and queen of werewolves.
      
      
      From being blamed for something that she was not responsible for at the mere age of 5 to being sent away, she had nobody else but herself to depend on. 
      What will happen when she is called back by her family. 
      
      
      Did they finally realise their mistake?
      Or is it for something else?
      Read to find out how Analise life takes a whole turn.

Despite her father‚Äôs peculiar practices and unusual interest in the unknown, she yearns for an adventure outside her dull and ordinary life, and gladly partakes in the excitement.
    
    When Lilith first arrives in the beautiful, untamed wilderness of the Carpathian Mountains, she is alive with feeling and a sense of belonging, but her journey takes a sudden dangerous turn when perilous truths begin to unravel and the dark Carpathian hills reveal a deadly secret of its own.
    
    In the midst of darkness and betrayal, Lilith finds herself at the mercy of a dangerous and unworldly creature, baring fangs and a ravenous thirst that seems to yearn for her blood alone. She is frightened yet drawn by the creature that appears as a man but hunts as a predator. Can she find love in a world filled of darkness and insatiable desires?

i had to look up at him since he was so close to me. i backed up hitting the wall, his body pressed on mine. 

""you want to know why i get all worked up when i see other guys around you? do you want to know why i get so angry when you treat other guys so innocently?"" i nodded my head

he groaned & ran a hand through his hair ""you really are clueless aren't you!""

when i didn't reply he spoke again ""because you make me feel things aurora! i cant control myself! every time i see another guy around you i want to rip them to shreds!"" he yelled 

""why on earth would you feel things?! you don't even like me Leo!"" i retorted

""I DO!"" 

---------------------------------
an angel meets a devil. They both were so different yet so similar. In the end they both learned the same lesson; that Love is a strength not a weakness. 

this story is set in a Dystopian era Where Mafias, Gangs & Mobs gained control over everything. They flipped the world upside down creating their own system. the only way to survive is to abide by their rules. 

Aurora Amherst. a 21 year old girl. Kind, compassionate and has a strange sense of humor. Enjoys hacking for fun. isn't scared to speak her mind.

Leonidas Gambino. Leader of the Sicilian Italian Mafia; the strongest mafia on this earth. He is brutal, violent and without an ounce of mercy in his body. He is the description of the devil. He controls everything from the down low.

what happens when she hacks into his Mafia's system ""accidently""?

    In the previous life, Ling Fan was a total loser and poor cannon folder who fell in love with a white lotus. After rebirth, he wanted to be a smart guy.
    
    As for the white lotus? Sorry, I would no longer have feelings for you! As for his rival in love, the man who could crush him like crushing an ant, he remembered him! When he was strong enough, he'd get even with him!
    
    See how a young man who got his bad side awakened after rebirth married his rival in love and climbed to the pinnacle of life!

    Description
    Mu Xiaoke was a fool in his previous life, but he couldn't help and his older brother both fell in love with Fu Jiayun. He is a little mute who's a total failure, how could the other party choose him? He shouldn't compete with his older brother, or marry the Rong family as a substitute for his older brother, otherwise he wouldn't die alone in the wilderness and his corpse wouldn't be found.
    
    God gave him a chance to be reborn. When he returned to his first year in senior high school, he knew that he could not repeat the same mistakes again. He had to stay away from his older brother, Fu Jiayun, and Rong Yanzhe. The person who treated him as a stand-in for his older brother and kept abusing him. This time, he didn't ask for anything, as long as he could live well.
    
    It just didn't occur to him that when he kept a respectful distance from those people, they instead came to pester him endlessly. He was in panic and unexpectedly provoked another man who shouldn't be approached...

But Diana and Alex couldn't be more opposite; put them in an art room together and a disaster is bound to happen.

    A girl moved to California two years ago.
    
    No one knows what she looks like.
    
    All they know is that she wears a hoodie.
    
    
    *~*~*~*
    
    
    ""HOLY SHIT, NOAH! WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU LET THE TROLLEY GO?! COME BACK! OH MY FUCKING LIFE, FIZZY DRINKS UP AHEAD--""
    
    BANG
    
    FIZZ
    
    POP
    
    ""...am I dead?""
    
    I'm suddenly grabbed by the back of my hoodie and pulled up from the ground and out of the mess of the opened bottles of fizzy which had exploded when the trolley and I crashed into them.
    
    My hands instantly go to my hood and I sigh in relief to find that it hadn't fallen off through all of that.
    
    I turn my head and look the the employee who's holding me, his face completely red and the vein in his neck throbbing.
    
    ""Wassup, dude?"" I smile sheepishly.

There is a very popular saying on the Internet: 
If it goes well, this life will be a dog with his beloved, and travel the world. If it doesn't go well, get married and have children. 

Zhang Xu had a flash marriage with a strange man that night when he broke up in love. 

Before I had time to pay homage to my first love, my life was broken by the sudden little baby, and my life became tumultuous! 

What should I do, I have children, will this trifling marriage continue?

 Bao Da Xu Bosu: I dare not close my eyes 24 hours a day, because I am afraid that my wife and children will be gone when I wake up.

 A rich second-generation good man who fell out with his home attacked X Slippers and pants, but he was actually rich and hot, so he should be cautious when he was born in the city.

He is one of the richest men in India who holds the power of money in the market and of leaders in parliament. He is one of those chosen people who are running the country behind the curtain. Politician bows their head in front of him, businessman is ready to put everything at stake just to put their name with his company and a messiah to his kingdom's people. His soft side is for no one at least he does pretend that.

But.........

A small brown-eyed, honey-voiced girl entered his life. And from the very first moment he saw her, he started feeling a weird fluttering in his heart. She was chosen by his grandfather for him but he knew it was God's plan.

She is a puzzle,
He wants to solve her.

She is scared,
He wants to protect her.

She fears love,
He wants to spoil her.

She is broken,
He is her healer.

Let's join Aashrit Singh Yaduvanshi and Meera Singh Yaduvanshi in the journey of love after marriage.

When Arianna's older sister, Olivia, decides to run away on the day of her wedding, Arianna is forced to take her place to save her family from ruin. But her new husband is angry, heartbroken, and seems to hate her guts. The cold, elusive billionaire Zach Price has never quite struck Arianna as the kind of man she'd want to spend her entire life with. She was more than content with her sweet, thoughtful boyfriend Noah, but when circumstances force them together, Zach and Arianna's hearts get entangled in a way she never saw coming. As the couple grows closer, they must battle the demons of their past and of the lives they left behind - especially when Olivia returns and decides she wants Zach all for herself.

Neuvillette was no expert on reading other people's emotions. Granted, he spent 400 years living among humans, and he has come far in understanding them, but Furina was truly always the exception.

He thought he understood Furina. They spent 400 years together as companions, after all. Yet, at every turn, he realizes how little he truly knows Furina, who was like the oceans of Teyvat.

For Furina De Fontaine was like the deepest trenches of the sea, a mystery with a never-ending amount of secrets buried in her depths. The stormy gaze in her eyes, the warring emotions in those orbs never left her, even after her retirement as Archon.

    DISCLAIMER!!
    This novel was literally written in 4 months when I was at the age of 14 trying to overcome my obsession with the fault in our stars (yes, I used to read the book at a bare minimum of 3 times per week, if not once daily). I decided to write my own version of it and as you can see, it turned out like this. If you choose to read it and find it silly that is because it's written by a 14-year old. So, please don't write hate comments or anything. Thank you all, have a nice time reading it!

Maybe it was the way she looked at him, or the way she smiled at everyone in her line of sight, who knows. But, whatever the reason is, he hates it. He hates that he gave into that feeling when he met her. She manages to find her way into his mind 24/7, unlike any woman ever has. 
    
    She doesn't think she's ever seen someone as angry at the world as him. He can be rude and he doesn't always think about other's feelings before he speaks. A scowl somehow is always set on his face, like he was born that way. For any other person, a man like that would make you want to simply ignore him. But not her. She has her heart set on making him smile. Even just a little. Maybe even a laugh. And she is not giving up any time soon.

 Song Nuanxia was reborn, and the first thing she did was to hoard supplies. Beer, cola, mineral water, chicken, duck, fish and chocolate, she hoarded them, filling up several football fields. 

The second thing is to report the news, quietly send news to the country, and then stockpile the goods to prepare for the end of the world.

 However, an accident happened, and the zombies did not arrive as scheduled. Song Nuanxia: ""Should be lucky?"" Full of doubts: ""The end of the world, has it come or not?"" 

After a long time, she realized that not only the end of the world has come, but also various disasters are coming one after another, staged in turn. High temperature, drought, heavy fog, mildew, flood, extreme cold... and the unavoidable man-made disasters are frightening. Relying on tens of billions of supplies, Song Nuanxia won every minute. 

However, with a koi physique, she found that she couldn't stop hoarding. *** Others hide from disasters: machine guns, assault boats, conquerors, helicopters... Song Nuanxia hides from disasters: air nail guns, pedal boats, tractors, hot air balloons... 

It's true hoard! Gou, really Gou!

    Rae East has always cast herself off as a girl not worthy of a Mate. With a past of self-doubt and expectations of a hopeless future, her theory crumbles when she discovers she is mated to an Alpha. Not expecting anything from it, Rae finds herself in a confusing situation. Giving no clarity, her Alpha Mate brings her back to his pack with no purpose. 
         She sinks into herself, lost, alone, and in pain. With a Mate who has no interest in her whatsoever, Rae struggles to find her purpose in the pack and in her own world. 
         Not knowing if she has a future with the Alpha she can't help but want, Rae must search elsewhere for happiness like she had once planned. But with a taste of the bond she can't help but share, it becomes difficult to move on from the Alpha who holds her heart captive.

    When Chriselda stumbles upon the land of the Dawnfall Depths Pack to save her friend, she comes across her mate.
    
    She thought that he will run towards her, hold her in his arms and kiss her passionately.
    
    But none of these things happen.
    
    Her mate doesn't run towards her neither holds her in his arms and neither kisses her passionately.
    
    Instead of a loving mate, she finds a cold-hearted Alpha standing in front of her.
    
    And they always say that there's a story behind every cold Alpha.
    
    [NOTE : Not a Rejection Story.
    I believe that rejections don't exist in the werewolf world. If rejection existed, then werewolves wouldn't be having mates. I really find the idea of rejecting your mate absurd because mates are supposed to be the one for you, the one you cannot live without and the one who is supposed to be your soul mate.
    
    So, don't take this story as another rejection story. Also, I'm working really hard to make this story as non-clich√© as possible. If you're bored of the clich√© werewolf stories and want to read something unique, then you've selected the right book to read.
    
    I hope you'll enjoy reading this story.]

Now, to be better protected, the pack needs to get its official status, meaning it needs approval from the council. That's difficult enough as it is. However, considering her pack's background, her own past, and the fact that she's a female in a world ruled by men, her task is even more complicated. Then, there's the added bonus of her new mate, Mateus, alpha of the region's warriors.
    
    Ariadne isn't one to let some bothersome alpha mess with her life, right? Will she let Mateus in and finally learn she can rely on others, or will she turn him away? How many secrets can she keep before it all comes tumbling down?

* * * * *

Layla Foster has learned that people like her for one thing: her career. Being the heiress to Foster Fitness, her parent's multi-million, celebrity-filled gym chain,  has led to nothing  but fake friends, gold-digging boyfriends, and a lifetime of doing exactly what her parents want. She's ready to start something of her own: a new branch of the company that focuses on whipping Brides and Grooms into shape before their big day. But being on-site at McAden Orchard, the beautiful sprawling home of her first clients, is going to be hard thanks to the bride's brother Dawson. He's outspoken, nosy, opinionated... and more handsome than any movie star Layla's ever trained.

Dawson McAden doesn't do love. He was scorned once, and once was enough to have him trade in commitment for one-night stands. So why does it bother him so much that his sister's new trainer has given up on love, too? He's not looking for just one passionate night with the feisty, redheaded beauty, but is he ready to risk his heart again to go after the relationship he can't stop himself from wanting?

________________________________________________


The imperial Admiral Lucas dispatched his army, it is said to find someone in the hotel last night!

The reporter asked passionately: What if they were found?

Lucas' eyes were cold: Kill.

Public: ? ?

How come it's different from what they thought?

Attack perspective ‚ÜíThe grumpy Admiral Lucas despised the weeping Omega most in his life.

Looking for a partner?

It's impossible in this life.

If he insists... he preferred the gentle and honest Beta male secretary who can make coffee and matching clothes for him.

Submissive view‚Üí

Luo Ran is Lucas's male secretary, and he does the least human job in the entire empire.

He had to wait on his boss, and he had to face his subordinates, partners, admirers, and so on.

Not only that but he also has to carefully concealed that he was Omega and the object of that night, facing the danger of being killed at any time.

Until one day, he unexpectedly went into estrus in front of Lucas, and the sweet pheromone was exactly the same as that of the person that night.

It's over, he was going to be killed now.

""How bold."" Lucas took Luo Ran by the back of his neck, put an arm around his waist, and laughed: ""I'll kill you now...""

--Admiral Lucas, is in fact, an Iron-Blooded is a strict wolfdog who doesn't know how to choose a tie when he gets up in the morning without the help of his secretary.

--He's a gentle and refined man Secretary. He's strong enough to tear the machine armor.

    ‚Ä¢ The angst in here is beautiful. The plot here is intriguing. The hardships will seem real to you. 
    ‚Ä¢  Jungkook's way of understanding Jimin and his unconditional love for the actor will make you want to crave someone like him for yourself too.

475,"Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.
    
    Greek mythology is explicitly embodied in a large collection of narratives, and implicitly in Greek representational arts, such as vase-paintings and votive gifts. Greek myth attempts to explain the origins of the world, and details the lives and adventures of a wide variety of gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines and mythological creatures.

                                                                                                                               *******
    For years, Lexi Maxwell has endured the suffocating constraints of boarding school and chaperoned dances, and she is ready to detour from the perfect path her parents set her on. Luke Carrington is the swoon-worthy stranger who arrives to spice up her eighteenth birthday party, convincing Lexi that it's okay to ditch her uniform and spread her wings. 
    
    Despite Luke's charm and intelligence, Lexi's family shrugs him off and refuses to tell her why. In her mind, the man has more to offer than any gel-headed boy she's met. Not only does he share her interest in Greek mythology, but he has devoted his life to helping people cope with death. What could be more admirable than that? 
    
    When Lexi learns that her life has been a big fat lie, and the people claiming to be her family aren't who they say they are, she turns to Luke for solace. He is the only one who hasn't betrayed her, and he helps Lexi prove she isn't a little girl anymore. Once Luke earns her trust and her heart, Lexi is willing to follow him anywhere to keep him close. Even into the underworld.

    For thousands of years, the Queen of the Gods has put up with her philandering, arrogant, conceited and uncaring husband. She became known as a jealous and vindictive queen. But turning your husband's mistresses into a cow was justified, right?

Finally, she was free!

Aria Daniels has one of the most vivacious personalities ever. She is a crazy teenage girl that is impossibly hard to drag down. 

So what happens when she finds a letter telling her that her brother has been kidnapped and won't be returned unless she pays sixty thousand dollars?

She doesn't follow the rules of the letter and get the money. 

Oh no, in fact, she breaks into the kidnappers base with a bobby pin, steals their cupcakes, paints their abs with white paint and somehow ends up in London with a room full of gang members and a bright pink gun. 

This is one hell of a crazy story. 

~~~~~

WARNING: This book is weird as fuck. It's no joke, I am telling you now that all the characters might as well be high on drugs the whole time because some of the shit they do makes no sense but I promise it will make you laugh (if not I'll give you a cookie).

When he returned, everything he loved, and cared for was gone. Join him as he embarks on a crazy adventure when he became a temporary residence at the Belcher Household.

Note: I'll be starting off the fanfiction with Human Flesh as a way to buy some time to put Tanner's backstory in.

Also, there will be Nothing sexual in here. Just extremely light stuff. I will make some chapters which will set when they're older. 

Hope you enjoy.

    But, from time to time, your stories have made me cringe. 
    
    In commemoration of my review store hitting 100 reviews, I thought it was about time to break down my reviewing journey, with the help of a fellow reviewer, @awesomeSTG. This book will contain chapters regarding the common errors I see in stories, it will offer tips on how to make your story professional, and there will also be some sneaky rants about what people expect from a reviewer. 
    
    Welcome to 101 Writing Tips from an Exhausted Reviewer, featuring two very exhausted reviewers: @ray_of_sunshine9 and @awesomeSTG.
    
    Or, as perfectly said by @awesomeSTG: 
    
    Ladies and gentlemen, folks far and wide! Sharpen your quills, prepare your scrolls, and polish your fire-resistant armours, for we shall finally cool off your burning queries - or scorch you even more - with our word of wisdom (namely rants) and advice! Hear ye, hear ye!

""She danced up to the little looking-glass and peered into it. Her pointed freckled face and solemn gray eyes peered back at her.
""You're only Anne of Green Gables,"" she said earnestly, ""and I see you, just as you are looking now, whenever I try to imagine I'm the Lady Cordelia. But it's a million times nicer to be Anne of Green Gables than Anne of nowhere in particular, isn't it?""


Anne Shirley, with all her daydreaming, carelessness and chatter is not quite what Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert expect when they decide to adopt a child from the orphan asylum. But, after a while, they can't even realize what Green Gables had been without her. Anne's presence lights quiet old Green Gables like a candle lights a room.*

This time-old classic has delighted young and old alike for over a century. Full of vivid characterization,  humor, and love, this tale lives in the souls of many.

""Anne is the dearest and most loveable child in fiction since the immortal Alice"" - Mark Twain.

547,"NOTE: Definitely an Avenger's fic as much as a Loki one. It's kinda mixed ""reader"" and original character. I couldn't help but give her personality and, for reasons explained further down, a name. Still, if it was a true oc I'd have gone into greater depths with her background and put way more character preferences and stuff than I do, tho I still do sometimes. So it's not completely oc and is written in second person like an insert. Ok, on with the summary:
    
    Wren is your average nerd who, by means unknown to everyone, manages to open a portal to 2015 MCU. She sets off with the Avengers to stop the future events, such as Civil War, Ragnarok, Infinity War, and Endgame. Loki, her favorite character, is dragged into the mix, and she has to learn how to handle Loki in the flesh. Wren must adapt to the reality of being in the MCU, while also making sure that her love for the character Loki doesn't get her stabbed in the back by the live version.
    (yeah, basically the reader is dragged into the MCU in 2015, but has knowledge of movies from 2021. She does what any fan might do with that information and situation. Loki and Reader relationship is a main focus, because I couldn't help myself, but Avengers and MCU life is a big part.)
    Please forgive grammatical errors. Also, chapters later on get longer, but the first few are short because I was just having fun at first. I have the name Wren inserted for Y/N simply because my friend, when reading it, gave her that name so we didn't have to keep saying Y/N.

    * * * * * 
    
    As far as 17-year-old Delena Torres is concerned, friendship is nothing more than a quick way to get hurt. This has been her mindset for the past two months anyway, ever since her best friend Mei ditched her and started hanging out with her arch enemy.
    
    She's more than ready to spend summer vacation alone-- then her parents surprise her by signing her up for a photography course at Camp Create It, the summer camp she and Mei always dreamed of attending. Still, even if she has to be surrounded by other campers, Del's determined not to get attached to anyone. She'll spend the summer by herself, honing her photography skills and forgetting about Mei. Easy, right?
    
    Maybe, if it wasn't for the fact that her quirky cabin-mate seems deadset on becoming friends. Or if she could stop running into the cute guy from the kitchen staff. Oh, and if she wasn't in the middle of a prank war after one stupid attempt at revenge, since Mei just happened to show up at camp, too.

That year he was twenty-four years old, and she was twenty-two years old. He pressed her under her body, kissed him deeply, and sighed confusedly: ""Think about either ... call my husband ...""

     The heroine in the book is a black heart lotus, but the supporting characters are excellent, but the supporting characters all end miserably. Big Jun Ning looked at the cannon fodder script in her hand and felt no pressure at all. It doesn't matter if the cannon fodder is an educated youth, she comes with three-line abilities and a sky-defying space! 
    
    Soon after, the boss's cannon fodder script counterattacked and became the queen's script!

    Some rules were made to be broken.
    
    As a certified stand-up bro, Nick Maguire knows that some things in life are sacred: Do not skip ab workouts. Never back down from spicy foods. And always accept the outcome of Rock, Paper, Scissors. For these are the revered doctrines of The Bro Code, rules of conduct that have been passed down through the ages from bro to bro. 
    
    Heading into his senior year, Cassidy High's star soccer player has his priorities straight and intends to spend his time playing sports, hanging out, and living by the code. But when his best bro Carter's sister Eliza returns from studying overseas, the awkward, academic girl Nick remembers is different. 
    
    Carter might be Nick's bro, but Eliza becomes his whole world-and he has to make a choice between them. Is being with the girl of your dreams worth breaking the most important rule: never date your best friend's sister? Somehow, Nick never expected that following The Bro Code may have even bigger consequences than breaking it.

Fame can be deadly.

Out of the wreckage of environmental collapse, the country of Delicatum emerged. Its most popular celebrities are the Famoux, uniquely beautiful stars of a reality TV show called the Fishbowl. In a world still recovering from catastrophe, they provide a 24/7 distraction. 

Sixteen-year-old Emilee Laurence is obsessed with the Famoux-they provide a refuge from her troubled home life and the bullies at school. When she receives an unimaginable offer to become a member herself, she takes it. Leaving behind everything she's ever known, Emilee enters a world of high glamour and even higher stakes. 

Because behind their perfect image lies an ugly truth-an anonymous stalker has been dictating the Famoux's every move, and being popular really is a matter of life or death.

Each day she suffers at the hands of her abusive parents, but each night she is surrounded by a loving family who call her by a different name. Growing up in 1930's Virginia, no one has patience for a girl who might be mad, so Mollie strives to keep her dreams (and how often they intrude on her reality) a secret. But when her secret comes out, Mollie is sent to an asylum, though not before she and Howard are secretly engaged. It is at the asylum she discovers the dreams are echoes of her past lives. She's an immortal, if she makes a journey to claim her heritage. The problem is, if she continues down this path, she can never see Howard, the love of her life, again.

After years of torment, Mildred, a meek high school student, is determined to seek revenge against her bullying classmates. She intends to curse them with dark magic, punishing them for their cruelty - but in the process Mildred accidentally opens herself up to a terrifying demonic possession. The demon inside her is only too happy to fulfill Mildred's vengeful desires. Bodies start turning up with parts missing, eaten as though mauled by a wild animal...or perhaps something darker. Powerless, Mildred realizes that the murders are changing her in more ways than one...

When Haley discovers the truth behind Xavier, whose silence holds a deeper meaning, she sets her mind on making his life better one small step at a time.

Haley Rosamond is happy with her simple life, content under the wing of her father. Well-protected, she has no idea of the darkness surrounding Xavier Hunt, with his all-black attire and infrequent presence in school-accompanied by his bruises and scars. That is, until Haley catches a glimpse of Xavier's reality and is made to question everything she knows about family and life in general. The truth, she realizes, couldn't be more different from everything she has heard. Supported by her father, Haley sets her mind on helping Xavier any way she can, and what begins with tutoring sessions, free food, and random acts of kindness blooms into friendship and something a little more. But when Haley's admission into her dream college and another tragedy in Xavier's life threaten to undo everything she has worked for, Haley needs to decide if she'll stick by Xavier or simply be another person in his life that disappears.

""I know we can't.  That's why it's so exciting.""  He replies through kisses.  His effortless charm intoxicates me;  drowning me;  hunting me;  devouring me.

""What if my brother finds out?""  The perpetuated patter of the rain unable to subdue my groan as he digs his nails deeper into my skin.

But of course, from the pages of the novel he read, the protagonist stares right at him.

""Soren Rosenbaum,"" says the man, sword gleaming under the watchful sun. ""Who the hell are you?""

Qiu Jin transmigrated into a book once again.

Last time, he transmigrated into an omega with pheromones that could make people go crazy. This time the heavens were merciful and finally had him transmigrate into an alpha. Moreover, it was the sexiest alpha in the entertainment circle.

Unfortunately, it was a cannon fodder.

The main g≈çng in the original book was Ji Shenxiao, an aloof tyrant CEO. He was alpha to the max. His self-control was so strong that no matter how omegas tried to seduce him, he would remain unmovable like a mountain. Until he met the protagonist omega sh√≤u, which activated his second vein and turned him into the fiercest g≈çng dog.

And Qiu Jin was the cannon fodder alpha that competed with Ji Shenxiao. Arrogant and despotic, he tried to forcefully take, and grandly lost. He challenged the protagonist's bottom line again and again. In the end, his gland was destroyed, and his family fell into destitution.

In this regard, Qiu Jin expressed that he would not be a toxic alpha male, so protagonist you go scram. However, humans could not defy the fates, and just when Qiu Jin was striving to become a high-quality alpha, the pheromones that made all the alphas go crazy in the last world came back!

At that moment, he saw the protagonist g≈çng suppressing his desires till his eyes were red, and his pheromones went out of control.

Qiu Jin swallowed: ""Bro, let's talk this out...""

The alpha squeezed the back of his neck, his voice hoarse: ""But I prefer to do it directly.""

Love rivals become lovers. Alpha becomes omega.

Mia White was just an ordinary girl that walked the face of earth. She was who people looked up to. She had good grades, was the kindest person you'd ever meet, and was breathtakingly beautiful. Everyone in ClearHills Academy loved her. But, there were also some who feared and despised her.

Some people hated Mia because she was known as 'little miss perfect' and because she was claimed by the one who practically owned everything. Besides her best friend, Sarah, not many people approached her.

Most people feared that if they were to do something wrong, it would anger him. And that was the last thing people wanted.

Ace King was someone not to mess with. His father owns a powerful company that he would soon take over. He was what parents told their kids not become. He was the bad boy of ClearHills Academy.

Ever since Ace first laid eyes on her as kids, she was what he wanted most. Mia was the only person who he'd drop on his knees and bow down to, she was the only person he cared not to be feared by.

She was the only who could tame him.

""What is it dear? Do you want something else?"" his mother asked, looking down to see his attention focused on something.

Or rather, someone.

""Her,"" he said, pointing at a girl, sitting on a small wooden stool with a book in her hands. ""I want her.""

Marnie Jones is an ordinary 11th grader. Her only intentions are to get good grades and save money for college with her babysitting job. Everything is going to plan. Until she gets a job babysitting the high school bad boy, Zeke Blakely. 

The two come from complete different social groups, and Marnie automatically hates Zeke and his big ego and cocky attitude.

She's safe with an overthinking problem. 

As the two are seen hanging around school together, attention gets drawn to Marnie. Which she hates. But she also catches the eye of a handsome jock, too. 

And why, you ask, does a 17 year old boy need a babysitter? 

You'll have to read to find out.

Let's say decent...

First day at her new school...

Don't. Draw. Attention.

First impressions mean everything. Just one little screw up and she knew that she would have to wish her junior year goodbye.

So she decided to stick to this one grand rule that would ultimately determine her social life, reputation, and mentality. 

Survive through highschool.

How hard can it be right?

...

WRONG!!!!

She was reading in her room when she just decided to take one...

Little...

HARMLESS glance outside of her new bedroom window. 

But all of a sudden...

BAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

There stood a half naked, greek god bad boy right before her very own eyes!!

So you may ask, what do you do in a situation like this? 

SIMPLE.

You squat down in the middle of your bedroom floor...

Because that's obviously not embarrassing...

And start doing ninja rolls from one side of the room to the window curtains going COMPLETELY UNNOTICED.

Well... 

That is until you bang your head against the wall after doing a total of SIX slightly slanted ninja rolls right in front of your friendly...

Still without clothes...

Abs are present...

Somewhat very sexy...

Abs are still present...

Okay really good looking...

ABS I REPEAT ABS ON SHOW...

Hot, sexy, and did I mention ab-delicious Neighbor 

Or to be more specific...

Ashton Rider.

Say goodbye to an unnoticed school year, and hello to the bad boy's world.

    Until...
    
    He had a dream.
    
    In the dream he was just a character in a book, the ending was already predetermined.
    
    All his efforts were worthless under the aura of the main character Wen Yu.
    
    Because -
    
    He was a cannon fodder that set off the main character.

    Who was planning to leave the entertainment industry? ? ?
    
    The entire C city knew that the Wen family had a little prince who was loved by thousands of people, and his birthday party was so flamboyant and extravagant that it made the headlines.
    
    But what they didn't know was that Wen Yu wasn't the youngest prince of the Wen family. And the real young prince was abducted at an early age and hadn't been found.
    
    When the paternity test report came out, the Wen family couldn't wait to find Lu Wenxing, but they were afraid of scaring him.
    
    ""Xingxing, do you remember mommy?""
    
    ""Xingxing, I'm dad, does that ring a bell?""

652,"What up! This is my first XReader and as you may have guessed, it's a Mettaton x Reader. I hope all you Metta-fans are ready to go to the countryside with this. Why do I ask? Well, there hasn't been any country or southern XReaders featuring Mettaton and I thought it would be interesting to see one. I will give you the run down of the basics about you and your personality in this book and how it may contradict with Mettaton and his personality.
    
    You are a country girl (sorry dudes but I had to, I will change pronouns and add stuff for guys once I finish it.) You will be in 10th grade and a big introvert. You were sexually abused as a child by your father (or mother if you're male) and you were threatened and warned many times by your abusive parent and have been forced to follow rules and lie to your safe, trustworthy parent who later divorced when you finally spoke up about your trauma. You are really shy but when you get mad, you have an attitude and temper. You don't curse or sin since you do go to church every Sunday and don't like such things. You mostly draw, write, and listen to music when you get so anxious you can't handle the situation anymore. You will also be slightly tomboyish.
    
    Mettaton will just be himself: a major sinner, huge diva, enormous drama queen, and just fabulous. When he meets you he will try to get you to fall for his body (mainly his flippin' legs) and may seem like the bad boy type whereas your the good girl type (once again, I apologise, if you're a dude I promise to change it when I'm finished) and normally don't fall for things like that and know what to really look for. You have never dated anyone and yet he's dated pretty much every single one of his fangirls and gay fanboys. None of those relationships worked out. You sometimes make jokes about him and his personality which only offends him and he soon comes back with something suggestive.  But as you two get to know each other, you both start to see the best parts.

656,"Egyptian mythology is the collection of myths from ancient Egypt, which describe the actions of the Egyptian gods as a means of understanding the world. The beliefs that these myths express are an important part of ancient Egyptian religion. Myths appear frequently in Egyptian writings and art, particularly in short stories and in religious material such as hymns, ritual texts, funerary texts, and temple decoration. These sources rarely contain a complete account of a myth and often describe only brief fragments.

Inspired by the cycles of nature, the Egyptians saw time in the present as a series of recurring patterns, whereas the earliest periods of time were linear. Myths are set in these earliest times, and myth sets the pattern for the cycles of the present. Present events repeat the events of myth, and in doing so renew maat, the fundamental order of the universe. Amongst the most important episodes from the mythic past are the creation myths, in which the gods form the universe out of primordial chaos; the stories of the reign of the sun god Ra upon the earth; and the Osiris myth, concerning the struggles of the gods Osiris, Isis, and Horus against the disruptive god Set. Events from the present that might be regarded as myths include Ra's daily journey through the world and its otherworldly counterpart, the Duat. Recurring themes in these mythic episodes include the conflict between the upholders of maat and the forces of disorder, the importance of the pharaoh in maintaining maat, and the continual death and regeneration of the gods.

The details of these sacred events differ greatly from one text to another and often seem contradictory. Egyptian myths are primarily metaphorical, translating the essence and behavior of deities into terms that humans can understand. Each variant of a myth represents a different symbolic perspective, enriching the Egyptians' understanding of the gods and the world.

Set during the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of the city of Troy (Ilium) by a coalition of Greek states, it tells of the battles and events during the weeks of a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles.
  
  The Iliad is paired with something of a sequel, the Odyssey, also attributed to Homer. Along with the Odyssey, the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature, and its written version is usually dated to around the 8th century BC. Recent statistical modelling based on language evolution gives a date of 760-710 BC.

659,"Korean mythology consists of national legends and folk-tales which come from all over the Korean Peninsula. The origin may be a blend of Korean shamanism, Buddhist, Chinese myths, Confucian and Taoist legends and myths. The legends may also vary greatly by region, even within the country. For example, the people of Jejudo have a very different lifestyle from that of the mainland and so can generate different forms of the same myths.
    In Korean shamanism, animism was dominant as the prime source for religious life for the Korean people. Particular worship of mountains, animals, plants stem from the belief that they had souls and often show up in the folktales as well as talk about tributes and sacrifices, whether literal, or figurative.
    At the same time, there were gods that occupied certain domains and they would often show up in folktales as distant protectors that called on humans when asked to rather than interfering with every day life.
    
    Early in Korean history, the shamanistic religion was dominant and because early Korea was divided often into smaller domains, such as Silla and Goguryeo, Baekje, the folktales and myths tended to differ also by those regions. With the arrival of Buddhism in the 3-4th century, the myths and native religion began to change as did the myths. With the advent of Neo Confucianism, the native religion was suppressed by the government where shamans were often killed for practicing and so many of the legends either changed or were blended into existing legends.

660,"Celtic mythology is the mythology of Celtic polytheism, the religion of the Iron Age Celts. Like other Iron Age Europeans, the early Celts maintained a polytheistic mythology and religious structure. Among Celts in close contact with Ancient Rome, such as the Gauls and Celtiberians, their mythology did not survive the Roman Empire, their subsequent conversion to Christianity, and the loss of their Celtic languages. It is mostly through contemporary Roman and Christian sources that their mythology has been preserved. The Celtic peoples who maintained either their political or linguistic identities (such as the Gaels in Ireland and Scotland, and the Celtic Britons of southern Great Britain and Brittany) left vestigial remnants of their ancestral mythologies, put into written form during the Middle Ages.

""What do you think you're doing?""

""You seemed cold,"" he replied, voice sultry, alluring and tempting her far beyond what she thought she could endure. ""I thought to help. That's all.""

He ran his finger from her neck to her shoulder and she gasped as waves of pleasure hit her. She wanted it and her body ached for it. But it was-wrong! She took a deep breath to steady her voice. ""Let go."" It came out as a whisper, but it was commanding and more than she had hoped to accomplish with the torrent of lechery that was coursing through her.

""And leave you cold?"" His hand brushed her hair off to one side, brushing and exposing the nape of her neck, while the other stroke her stomach. ""That would be ungentlemanly.""

Raneem could do nothing but bite her lips to keep herself from crying out. She noticed how quickly she was breathing and cursed herself. He knew he was playing her like a fiddle and she was sounding out silent notes that told him he was doing things right. She stiffened and sucked in breath as his lips pressed at the nape of her neck.

    ***
    Parker Sims is the class clown but that doesn't mean he's easy to fool. And that's just what Nola B. is good at - fooling people. She's got the whole school believing that her scars, bruises, and broken bones are from being clumsy. However, Parker sees through the lies. He knows there's another reason why she flinches at the touch of other people, the way she's alert and watchful, how she wears long sleeves (even in the middle of the summer), or even the way she keeps losing weight, staggering to an unhealthy size. 
      
      Parker saw all the signs; it killed him from the inside out to know what she was going through.
      
      So, he called the cops and reported his suspension that Nola was being abused. 
      
      That was a total joke, he found out... 
      
     Parker thought of everything in the book but each attempt, to get someone to notice she was being abused, failed - epically. He'd no other options . . . except for one thing. . . 
      
      Kidnap her - take her away from whoever was abusing her; give her the life she deserves. 
      
      It was a crazy idea, and he knew it - that's exactly why he shook the idea out of his head. . . 
      
    That was until he saw her come to school with a black eye and limping while holding her sides. Parker snapped and did the one thing he swore he'd never do-
      
      Kidnap Nola B., for her own protection.

669,"Genevieve Salvatore is just a nineteen year old girl attending university to become a mathematician. But she is not ordinary nor is she normal like her fellow classmates - in fact, she's far from that. She began having nightmares right after her fourteenth birthday and all those nightmares were the same every single time, the same events happening over and over again. Nothing changes in her nightmares that are all frightfully terrifying until the day she meets the man who offers her protection inside of them.
  
  Thrown into a world where everything is still new to her, where she needs to fight temptation against Alastair Ignacio - the man who she sees in her nightmares before she even meets him - and where she needs to learn about herself as well as the truth about the world she belongs to, Genevieve faces difficulties and choices she could never have fathomed coming across. It isn't too soon that she realises that there is more truth to what meets the eye and that she has a heavy responsibility laying on her shoulders.
  
  The fate of it all relies in her hands.

I hope you enjoy this story! Also, on the side note, Quite a lot of this story will have nitbits of JK Rowling's actual Harry Potter, so if you find  scene in particular, quite familiar, that's the reason.

This is going to be a Harry Potter's twin sister fanfic, and she's going to be the daughter of... I'll let you guess...

You do magic once, and it sticks to you like glitter glue... 
When Johnny and his best friend, Alison, pass their summer holidays dabbling in magic, they never expect it to have consequences. Sure, it'd be great if they could banish bullies or change their lives for the better, and what harm could come from lighting a few candles and chanting a few spells? They get their answer in the form of an earthquake unleashed at their behest, which draws the attention of the Marduk Institute, an age-old organization dedicated to fostering the talents of young wizards. 

Whisked away to the institute and told they can never return to their old lives, Johnny and Alison must quickly adapt to a new world shimmering with monsters, fraternities, and cute boys like Hunter and Blake. But when they're pulled into a dark, supernatural fight that could cost them their lives, they'll have to find strength they never knew they had as they battle for love, acceptance, and their own happy endings -- all with the help of a little bit of magic.

When she agrees to visit an art school in Boston, she encounters a woman, Roseanne Park, whose paintings take her breath away. Jennie realizes Roseanne is not a student, but lives in a remote wing of the school and the maddeningly frustrating headmaster is her mother. 
    
    Mesmerized by Roseanne and her art, Jennie learns the young woman has Asperger syndrome. Roseanne awakens something in Jennie she didn't know she was capable of. Having suffered from a profound loneliness for most of her life, Jennie develops an overshadowing love and protectiveness toward Roseanne. As she learns more about Roseanne and her heartbreaking family situation, Jennie is amazed at how courageous and brilliant she is.
    
    Can there be a future with a woman like this, and will Roseanne, who can only put words to her emotions through her paintings, return her feelings?

(Sequel to How to be a Queen) Aerith and Hades already have their fairytale ending. They've also been blessed with twins: Aidon and Aurea. I'm Aurea by the way and this is my story. When I was born, the Fates declared that me and my brother will live a difficult life. And I guess they were right for we were both born with no powers.

 We were two new immortals who cannot be a god and a goddess for we had no powers. Is this a curse? Nah. Maybe we were just born this way or maybe we were just late bloomers? I sure hope so. Oh, one more thing. When my brother and I turned eighteen, the Three Fates came to our party and allowed us each a question. Being a naive little girl, I asked. ""Who will I share eternity with?"" They answered with: ""You are meant for death.""

 Well what did they mean with that? Am I meant to die? Will I ever get my powers? Will I ever find someone who'll love me? Will I get the fairytale ending my parents have?

Reading Purifying Love made Rachelle D'magiba feel very insulted. The ending that the author had written didn't go well with her expectations. Rather, it was one of the shittiest novels that she ever had read. 
 
But just because of one mistake, she found herself inside the novel that she had read. She had thought that she had already died but it seems that she went inside the novel!  What's even worse is that she reincarnated as the villain of the story! None other than Felicia Vivianne Del Montague who was burned alive.

Will she be able to escape and save herself from dying once again? Or will she find truths to uncover from the novel and avoid her death flag?

    Patience is often considered a virtue.
    When necessary, even if it costs them everything, one will wait. They will beg and cry and pray, but they will wait. For rescue, for amends, for solvency.
    However, those who do not wish to exercise such a virtue - who have already given whatever they had to offer, who cannot weather any further suffering - will act.
    Their motivation varies. Loss, justice, regret, anger, hatred.
    A constant emerges from all:
    Heartbreak.

These names are a few of the greatest NBA players the basketball world has seen. And one player, in particular, has the mindset to join those names.

(YN) (LN), a five-star prospect and top high school basketball player is shaping up to deliver that promise, so much so that that the country and NBA have set their eyes and minds on you.

Everyone recognized and enjoyed watching you perform on the court; including nine very specific girls.

While very busy, a specific K-pop group named Twice has become quick fans of you; entertaining and intense is what they described you and each of them became a secret fan of yours to the world.

Unknown to them, you admired them back; their music, the nine, everything about them was positive. 

And unknown to both, it seems like fate has decided to bring the two together.

    Su Muluo is the only remaining phoenix of the Phoenix clan, and he also has a marriage partner, the last dragon of the dragon clan.
    
    But his dragon had been in the egg for 1,800 years, and so far there was no sign of breaking the shell.
    
    One morning, Su Muluo stared at the dragon egg for a while, and finally made up his mind to cook it.
    
    The pot was steaming hot, and just as he was about to put the dragon egg into the water, the dragon egg that had been silent for a thousand years suddenly cracked open with a crack.

    The real dragon appeared in this world, and the director of the foreign bureau was trembling and brought people to visit.
    
    Then they saw a tiny black dragon coiled around Phoenix's wrist, and aggressively spit out a fireball at them.

If there was an award labeled 'Two Faced Bitch' Percy Jackson would've slapped Esmeralda Beckendorf's name on it and presented it to her like an Oscar. She wasn't two faced in the sense that she would trash talk him, because she didn't. She was two faced in the sense that he could never tell if she liked him or not, and this drove him mental. One day he thinks they're friends, the next she's got her sword at his throat, and maybe once in a while he might think she was flirting. It was hard to tell with Esme, but Percy was willing to take his chances for her.

    Wanda E. Pangestu, meneliti berbagai pesta pernikahan orang asing sebagai referensi novelnya yang sudah harus terbit dalam waktu dekat. Tidak disangka, dari begitu banyak pesta yang diselenggarakan hari itu, Wanda menyusup masuk ke dalam pesta pernikahan tanpa pengantin wanita dan berakhir menggantikan sang pengantin wanita! 
    
                                  ---
    
         Wanda Elka Pangestu seorang penulis yang identitasnya dirahasiakan demi kenyamanan hidup sehari-hari, tidak ada alasan khusus selain itu. Demi tahap akhir novelnya yang sudah dijadwalkan terbit dalam waktu dekat, Wanda diharuskan mencari referensi mengenai pesta pernikahan oleh penyunting naskah untuk melengkapi bagian akhir novel.
    
         Sebagai seorang penulis yang profesional, Wanda menyusup masuk ke dalam beberapa pesta pernikahan. Satu, dua, hingga tiga pesta pernikahan yang ia hadiri tanpa undangan terasa belum cukup sehingga ia kembali menyusup masuk ke dalam pesta pernikahan yang ternyata cukup mewah, dan parahnya tidak ada pengantin wanita!
    
         Wanda yang menyadari keabsenan pengantin wanita, tidak pernah mengira bahwa ia akan dijadikan pengantin wanita oleh sang pengantin pria yang pada akhirnya diketahui bernama Bryant Nathanael Ethan. Setelah dimintai tolong, yang lebih menjurus pada paksaan dan perjanjian, Wanda menyetujuinya. Wanda akan berlaku seperti seorang istri pada umumnya dan sebagai gantinya, Bryant akan melakukan beberapa hal-hal romantis sesuai permintaan Wanda demi inspirasi novelnya.

    This is the sequel of ""At the Crossroads."" Towards A Flowery Path is written in such a way that it can also stand alone so it's entirely up to you if you want to read At the Crossroads first.
    
    Like its prequel, this story has been posted first at AFF with different characters. This is thus a rewritten version with Dahyun, Jungkook and Jimin as the main.

It would've been fine to be bounded to someone's deepest secrets, unless if that someone was Aiden Walker, a boy who's anything but predictable. What she doesn't know is how deep his secret runs and how much it's going to cost her.

*Author's Note* 
Hey, it's my first x reader. So be nice. Constructive criticism is welcome, but not unnecessary bashing. I understand I'm not perfect, thanks. 

Also, the first part of this story takes place in the early 1800's, while the latter part takes place in modern times (to find out why you should read it lol :p). Due to this, I have done extensive research to make the times as accurate as possible. With that having been said, the only inaccuracy that I can think of is the fact that the school of Juilliard (lol yup you heard that right ;p) wasn't founded until 1905. But for the sake of my timeline and laziness, we're gonna pretend it was around in 1810, okay? Okay thanks. 

The Beetlejuice in this fic is based on the one in the musical, not the movie or show. However, feel free to imagine him however you want. 

Thanks if you read this far. 

Um okay enjoy I guess. God I have no idea what I'm doing anymore lol someone plz shoot me hahahaaa üôÉ

    At twenty-seven, Tacha wants to build a career. Even when Nathan Brown had access to open the door of her heart for the second time, she slammed it to his face over and over again. They said she was doing too much, but all she had to do was look in the mirror and see her mother who never took her stand. Will she choose the man who can build her career in a go or choose the woman who seeks after her future ruthlessly?
    
    Tacha has to choose.
    
    Will it be safe to try again or never again?

807,"~A  Wattys and Fiction Award winner*
    A lion does not need an invitation from a lamb. That is not the way of the predator. Predators take what they want, when they want it, however they please. And this belief that I am, that evil is, enslaved by the dark night is humorous to say the least. Why would any creator make their pupil inept of withstanding the lighted world when this planet is covered in daylight for half of its life span? No, our Maker did not instill such restrictions for, up here on these earthly lands, we are the gods of prey. ~ Tristan 
    
    There is only one rule vampires must follow--Bite Hard. It is forbidden for humans to know vampires exist so you can imagine Tristan Darkos's surprise when he finds one that knows what he is. He can tell by the tremble of her body, the thump-thump of her pulse, and her dilated pupils. He's going to have to finish what some other vampire started. 
    
    The problem is when Tristan gets close to this human his blood turns to fire and the thirst that burns in his throat that should spell her doom twists until he's consumed by another need--one that is evocative, primitive, and...wrong.
    
    If Tristan doesn't figure out the mystery that is Kinley Shea Rylan, it is certain whatever dark force her honey blood is summoning forth will be the end of him and, possibly, the end of the world as we know it.

    Aviana Birchwood's world crumbles when the Keep of the Dratlan Elves where she has lived since she was a girl is attacked and torn apart by unearthly creatures.
    
    As the only survivor of the massacre, the fate of the Empire is twisted with her own. She finds herself burdened with powers none can understand and an unwilling heroine to the very people who shun her kind.
    
    She must ally herself with those who believe her. An insufferable and honour bound Captain,  the last male of a dying species and a Magin who has broken away from her own kind. 
    
    They are four people with their own goals, their own agendas who are forced together to save an Empire on the brink of destruction.

    How long would a marriage be able to sustain itself when it had nothing to do with love? Then how would a marriage based merely on power and a monetary transaction be able to last?
    
    The person in Shang Yushang's embrace was his male wife. A temporary wife that was bought to get rid of bad luck. But ever since the moment he had this person in his arms, he decided not to let go of him.
    
    He Changning obeyed his so-called family's decision and married himself off. Thinking that, when this transaction was over, he can live his own life happily ever after. But, little did he know that he had just stepped into a big net filled with warmth that was specially woven for him, and that he would never have a chance to get out of it.

      What will happen when Caroline meets a guy who is rich, and too much proud of his money? or that is what she thinks.  What will she do when she realises she is falling deeper and deeper for that guy? Will she confess her feelings for him? Will she be able to forget her dreadful past, and give him a chance?

    On the other hand, Conrad is quite the opposite. He's a ruthless and cold person who gets annoyed easily and has anger issues.

    One day, fate brings Andromeda and Conrad together, and their worlds collide in a way they never could have imagined. Despite their vastly different personalities and backgrounds, they're drawn to each other in a way that neither of them can understand. As they get to know each other, they realize that they have more in common than they thought, and they start to develop a deep and meaningful connection that neither of them expected.

    Vansh.
    
    It was still a blur but she could distinctly remember his voice, the warmth of his body and comfort of his arms holding her close to him. He'd whispered soothing words to her, little lies that made her feel calm and at peace. But most of all it had been the smell of his skin and cologne and that indescribable scent that was just Vansh. The same scent that had started her heart racing on the dance floor had also made her realize that she was safe.
    
    She quietly put the books aside, not wishing to relive anymore of her experiences. She knew now that she had been right, she did feel a real connection with these characters but she didn't want to face that right now.
    
    Instead Riddhima curled up, hugging her pillow close and shut her eyes. She pretended that she was in Vansh's arms again, letting the smell of him envelope her completely. This was what made her feel safe and secure, like she wasn't falling apart. Only this.

Or the lack of normal guys against the overwhelming number of bad boys and players on the planet known as Wattpad? Ever felt like ranting that how overused love triangles, gangs, mafias, billionaire, sci-fic dystopia tropes are? Or reading a book where the MC is described as a toad but is being played by Angelina Jolie or Shakira herself?

However, what was worse  was being kidnapped, held captive for years, and then being auctioned off to the highest bidder. I thought maybe I had caught a little break when I found out that me and five other girls were being sold to royalty, but I should have known something about that wasn't right either.
Under the cover of eternal darkness, and deep beneath the ground, was a whole world I never even dreamed existed in my wildest dreams. It was a world that promised to be more than anything I could imagine. The people who bought us told us we would have the luxurious life of a princess, but there were only two catches...

1. We would be competing against each other for the affection of the Prince who would change our whole lives by picking one of us to rule at his side.

2. That prince just happened to be a vampire.

    <><><>
    
    Sometimes the universe's greatest mystery... is the person right next to you.
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Twenty five years have passed since the Weeping Angels took Manhattan and heartlessly snatched Amy and Rory away, sending them to their deaths. After that fateful day, the Couple of Time took their two little ones and went and raised them as normally as they could. No traveling (for the most part). No monster chases. No life or death situations. Just a life hidden away where no one knew who any of them truly were.
    
    All that changes on Christmas Eve 1892 as the snow falling in Victorian London becomes the stuff of fairy-tales, and then, nightmares. But, the Doctor and Lexi have become a bit reclusive and are determined not to engage in the problems of the universe. Will they really abandon humankind or will they fight to save the world? What will they do when they fail to save the two people who convinced them to finally get off their cloud?
    
    The clever boy and the glorious girl begin running again.
    
    The Doctor and Lexi kick off their new run of adventures by searching for their companions Clara and Lucas. And believe me, the Glorious will stop at nothing to finally figure out just exactly who her Impossible Man is. And the Doctor is right there with her with the mystery of his Impossible Girl. They'll do whatever it takes to find and protect their Impossibles with everything they've got.
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    In other words, the Doctor and Lexi set off on an epic journey... that could cost them everything.

For once, her life was actually...good. She was the Leader of Camp Half-Blood. She had the best friends she could ever ask for. And she had a boyfriend that liked her so much that he turned down immortality for her. 
And then the rug was pulled out from under her and she was plunged into the worst time of her life when her boyfriend, when Percy Jackson, the demigod that had her heart from the second she first kissed him, went missing. He just up and vanished. 
But once again, I don't think you want to hear about any of that. 
You're here to hear how they found The Lost Hero. 
You're here to hear how they followed the Mark of Athena.
You're here to hear how they braved the House of Hades. 
And you're here to hear how they are the Blood of Olympus. 
However, this warning is much more dire than the last and this quest much more ferocious. It is most certainly not for mortals and the faint-hearted. 
But for those brave enough to embark on this quest, I wish you luck and may the gods be with you.

     Jiang Tinglan opened her eyes again and found that not only was she married at such a young age, but she also had a sixteen-year-old son.
    
    „ÄÄ„ÄÄMy husband is busy with his career and is away from home all the year round. He doesn't have people around him, but he has money. My stepson lives with his parents-in-law in an old house in the capital. It's not too comfortable to live alone.
    
    „ÄÄ„ÄÄAccording to the plot, her stepson can become a big boss in the business world in the future.
    
    „ÄÄ„ÄÄHowever, this has nothing to do with her at all, because soon she will cheat on her classmate because she cannot bear the loneliness, and will live a trivial life from then on.
    
    „ÄÄ„ÄÄJiang Tinglan came across:...? ? ? ? Is it difficult to live in a big villa or is it because the money is not good enough? If you want her to suffer the hardships of life, that's not possible.
    
    „ÄÄ„ÄÄShe decided not only to cling to the lap of her cheap husband, but also to take advantage of the golden age to make a lot of money.
    
    „ÄÄ„ÄÄBut when she opened her eyes the next day, the man who had not been home all year actually appeared in the kitchen. Jiang Tinglan looked at the man whose back muscles tensed through his shirt and formed a strong mountain. She felt that this was a good deal.
    
    „ÄÄ„ÄÄShe shouted happily to her husband and was about to run towards the man, but was blocked by the man who suddenly came in from the entrance hall.
    
    „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe man in front of her was even better. Before Jiang Tinglan could take back the surprise on her face, the man pinched her chin and asked, ""Who do you call husband?""
    
    „ÄÄ„ÄÄAt this time, the dishwasher in the kitchen also turned around.
    
    „ÄÄ„ÄÄJiang Tinglan looked at the two completely similar faces. They were both cold and arrogant, and she was confused. So who is her husband?

932,"Book 1 in the Fenton Falcon Series

When Ella Gillard finds her high school sweetheart across the country and in bed with another girl during her freshman year, she makes a promise to herself to never date another hockey player--no matter how tempting it may be. Law school is complicated enough without the distraction of a relationship. But her plan proves to be difficult when she's met with the very persuasive goalie of the Fenton Falcons. 

Fenton University's hockey team is full of pre-game rituals, and their starting goaltender, Hendrix Tate, is as superstitious as they come. When the team's losing streak is broken after he finds Ella's bracelet minutes before a vital mid-season game, Hendrix is adamant on keeping his good luck charm around. Especially with his position being threatened by the team's new pickup. 

The question is will Ella break her promise to herself or shut him out?

i appreciate all the love and support im getting on this book!

although this book is coming to a close, it is still my work. (not that i think this would be a problem, since it's a sickfic book but still..) plagiarism is a crime (not literally but you get the point.) all chapters in this book belong to me, please do not steal or paraphrase my work and call it your own. 

i do not take translations.

945,"Manik Malhotra, Nandini's soulmate & Cabir's best friend, has been missing for the past 4 years, presumed dead in a car accident he had been involved in, yet the circumstances of his disappearance were strange. For the past 4 years, the two had teamed up to search for Manik, but remained empty-handed, encountering dead-ends. While Nandini was believed to be living a mirage by refusing to accept Manik's death, Cabir was accused of encouraging her delusional behavior. Just when all hope seemed lost, Nandini supposedly found him.
    
    ""I know I have been proven wrong before, but it was him..."" Nandini recounted, vividly.
    
    Battling with the fear of Nandini losing her sanity and the hope of finding Manik, Cabir, along with Nandini, embarks on a journey to find him.

    Manik Malhotra had been on the brink of losing his sanity for years now, torn between reality and imagination, confusing one with the other, he had thought he had been running behind a mirage. He was told there was no Nandini, yet right before he was standing the girl everyone claimed had been only a figment of his imagination...

    Description:
    
    Cheng Shenmo transmigrated into a village doctor and rescued a handsome man who lost his memory and the two fell in love.
    
    One day, the man regained his memory and is name was Han Ying, the general of the dynasty. He asked Cheng Shenmo to go back to Beijing with him.
    
    Cheng Shenmo glanced at Han Ying's muscular waist, thinking he couldn't give up halfway.
    
    Unexpectedly, Han Ying also has a top-notch Bai Yueguang with fair skin and beautiful long legs, he's o beautiful that it is indisputable.
    
    Han Ying held Bai Yueguang with his left hand and held Cheng Shenmo tightly with his right hand: ""Qingqing is like a bright moon in the sky and Ah Mo is like a breeze in the mountains.""
    
    This familiar smell of dog blood...
    
    Cheng Shenmo remembered the novel he had read, which told the story of the great general swinging back and forth between the white moonlight and the cinnabar mole.

    Being famous in a world filled with danger has many disadvantages. Being so vulnerable to everyone, someone is bound to find you. 
    
    Even if it's an accident.
    
    When Hoodie accidentally breaks into the wrong house, he finds Y/n, a celebrity known to many. Instead of his usual routine, he finds himself following them around, learning new things of them and himself. 
    
    Y/n finds their life going through unexpected changes, everything coming at them all at once, all while keeping their career alive and personal life a secret.
    
    Oh, and they also fall for each other. 
    
    Hard.

979,"Xia Huai Zhi had the appearance of a top-tier sweet girl, but at the age of 16, she unexpectedly presented as a top-tier Alpha. And to make matters worse, the person she had a crush on, Fu Lin, was also an Alpha.
    
    Four years later, they reunite, and Fu Lin has become a well-dressed CEO with an outstanding temperament that suits her taste better than the inexperienced youth he once was. Determined, she sets her mind to win him over and then... to mercilessly tease him
    
    *
    
    To achieve her goal, she disguises herself as a sweet and innocent little bunny, gradually luring Fu Lin into her own rabbit hole. Just when she thinks she has caught her prey, he suddenly breaks free from her grasp, attempting to escape her world
    
    Xia Huai Zhi initially thought she would feel disappointed, but she suddenly realizes that she's even more interested in this hunting game. After all-
    
    The harder the prey is to obtain, the more satisfying it is to devour.
    
    *
    
    On the day when her Omega identity is exposed, Fu Lin weakly sits slumped in a corner of an abandoned factory, exuding a cold and minty fragrance. Beads of hot sweat roll down from his jawline, disappearing into the rise and fall of his chest with each breath. Without a doubt, he needs an Alpha right now.
    
    But as she approaches, he points a gun at his temple and threatens, ""If you dare come any closer, I'll die right in front of you.""
    
    ...
    
    Half an hour later, he voluntarily leans in beside her, giving her a compromising hug.
    
    ""You must be Heaven's punishment sent to me.""
    
    ""Otherwise... why would I feel the same pain when you cry?""

993,"As if it wasn't enough to be hit on the head by my co-workers and boyfriend, I died at the hands of my gambling-addict older brother.
    Without even regretting my unfortunate death, I realized that I had possessed a supporting role in a romantic fantasy novel, which I just read yesterday.
    To be precise, a villainess destined to die at the hands of her husband. I know it's clich√©!
    
    'Possessed a villainess in a romantic fantasy novel! So this is what it feels like?'
    
    I thought it was pretty good for the price of my unfair death.
    Until I realize that no matter what I do, I can't deviate from the flow of the original.
    For the female lead Liz√©, it's a delightful cider series, but it's nothing more of a bloody story for Edith, the villainess I possessed.
    
    I am the protagonist in my life.
    If I'm going to die according to the original story, I should at least kiss my super handsome husband!
    In the original story, Edith is greatly despised by her husband, but who cares, I'm going to die anyway.
    However...
    
    ""You pretended not to be, but now you're so hot to play with. Well, that's good.""
    ""Yes...?""
    ""Satisfy me like Riegelhoff's serpent. Well, who knows? I might be interested in that body of yours.""
    
    ...why is the original story starting to change now?

    She is a fan of Monster Mash, the boy band that has captured the attention of the entire world thanks to the different and attractive personalities of its six members, powerful voices, perfect bodies, handsome faces, and monster concept.

1005,"It's been years since the humans completely took over. The day the supernatural beings they knew from books and movies written long ago exposed themselves as real, humans sought to destroy them. Without giving the supernaturals a chance to speak or defend themselves, humans eliminated every species but the werewolves and vampires. The two were left alive to be sold as slaves, since their strength and speed were considered useful. 

Lillian Brave is an only child, a lonely book worm in a wealthy family. She believes slavery is wrong and has been able to live seventeen years without owning a slave. However, it is now being forced upon her by her mother as she reaches the age of eighteen. She spends three million dollars on a rather handsome looking vampire for a reason unknown to her. Instead of becoming her slave, this vampire that cost so much becomes much, much more.

    Anne is the mother of five, with never a dull moment in her lively home. And now with a new baby on the way and insufferable Aunt Mary visiting - and wearing out her welcome - Anne's life is full to bursting.
    
    Still, Mrs Doctor can't think of any place she'd rather be than her own beloved Ingleside. Until the day she begins to worry that her adored Gilbert doesn't love her anymore. How could that be? She may be a little older, but she's still the same irrepressible, irreplaceable redhead - the wonderful Anne of Green Gables, all grown up... She's ready to make her cherished husband fall in love with her all over again!*

Anne knows she's not what they expected - a skinny girl with decidedly red hair and a temper to match. If only she could convince them to let her stay, she'd try very hard not to keep rushing headlong into scrapes or blurt our the very first thing she had to say. Anne was not like anybody else, everyone at Green Gables agreed; she was special - a girl with an enormous imagination. This orphan girl dreamed of the day she could call herself Anne of Green Gables.

      Anne Shirley has left Redmond College behind to begin a new job and a new chapter of her life away from Green Gables. Now she faces a new challenge: the Pringles. They're known as the royal family of Summerside - and they quickly let Anne know she is not the person they had wanted as principal of Summerside High School. But as she settles into the cozy tower room at Windy Poplars, Anne finds she has great allies in the widows Aunt Kate and Aunt Chatty - and in their irrepressible housekeeper, Rebecca Dew. As Anne learns Summerside's strangest secrets, winning the support of the prickly Pringles becomes only the first of her triumphs.

We follow the story of Manado Chujin who as a child was locked away in the flesh pits by Shang Tsung. By the age of 12, he is found and rescued by the princess of Outworld but due to complications, has to leave the realm. He then finds himself in Earthrealm where he encounters its protector, the Thunder god known as Raiden. Raiden, seeing Manado's situation, decides to train Manado in the ways of kombat as his new champion. Then the mortal kombat tournament occurs and Manado finds himself reuniting with his rescuer and strange things start to occur, namely him finding out that a lot of the ladies find themselves attracted to him, much to his confusion.

Acts:

Act 1: Mortal Kombat 9 (Complete)

Act 2: Mortal Kombat X (Complete)

Act 3: Mortal Kombat 11 (In Progress)

Act 4: Mortal Kombat 1 (Incomplete)

      Full Description:
      Marinette Dupain-Cheng spent her time split between being a normal senior in high school and dreaming of handsome model Adrien Agreste and saving Paris from an unrelenting villain, Hawk Moth. In a stroke of luck, a few years ago Adrien enrolled in her school in Paris where she could see him every day. Unfortunately for her, she only managed to say one or two complete sentences around him without sounding like a total idiot.
      
      Adrien's life was torn between being hounded by fans or by being oppressed by his overbearing father. The only time that he ever truly feels free is when he takes form as his alter ego Chat Noir and is by Ladybug's side. When he turns 18, Adrien not only gains the ability to use unlimited Cataclysms he finally gains the attention of his crush and bugaboo, Ladybug.
      
      As Ladybug, Marinette always seemed to have the right amount of luck to save the day, with Chat Noir by her side, but as Hawk Moth's attacks grow stronger, her luck seems to be running out.

    Living with your crush seems exciting- I mean, it's a chance to get closer to him, right? But instead, what lies ahead is a road of rumors, lies, danger, confusion, awkward teenagers, and quite a few secrets that begin to turn both Adrien and Marinette's lives upside down. 
    
    While fighting for both of their identities, both are busy with their lingering emotions. Will either of them be able to confess how they really feel to one another before the year is up? Or will they forever remain oblivious to each other's identities and feelings?

    ""What about the promise we made when we were kids, Mari,"" He smiled. I felt shocked he remembered my nickname.
    
    That smile..
    
    A sudden wave of realisation washed over me, taking my wrist back. ""That promise died on the day you told me you never wanted to see me again, Adrien"" I spat his name out like a disease. I stormed out slamming the door, ""Our friendship died on the day you told me you never wanted to see me again."" I muttered

    Adrien and Marinette have been friends since they were kids, well used to be. It changed when Adrien lost his mother, blocking everyone out and getting involved with the wrong people. Soon taking his anger out on Marinette, let's say it didn't end well and she now hates him because of that.
    
    He was soon your typical player, he gets laid and the others get played as they say. Making out in the Halls, soon followed by who knows what in the janitors closet. Marinette simply hated him, not only for hurting her in the past, but just playing with peoples heart like a toy from his parents.
    
    She wasn't exactly a so called nerd, but more what people call her a Princess. Not because she's a picky person but more of because she has a heart of gold, willing to help everyone, everyone BUT Adrien. 
    
    Both hated each other, probably the one thing they have in common. It changed when they were assigned dorms, lucky for Marinette she got the one and only Player of the entire school.
    
    Will the two finally find out the reason behind each other's actions? Or will they forever be at each other's throats?
    
    This is the story of the Player and The Princess

        Lindsey Knightley has had a strained relationship with her elder brother, Dylan Knightley, after her parents and sister died in a car accident. Seven years later, Dylan is now the head of their family business, Knightley Industries. As for Lindsey, she glides through the distant thunder and storm in silence.
    
     One day, while exploring the attic of her ancestoral home, Edenfield, Lindsey finds an ordinary looking journal. Little does she know about the secrets of Edenfield written within this crimson- coloured diary. Secrets about her family's history in the Victorian era. Secrets that may cause a pandemonium even in the gardens of heaven.
    
     Along with her enthusiastic friend, Allison Crimsom, and quirky companion, Ethan Ingram, she tries to unveil them. 
    
        But these clandestine pages gift two offerings: They can either restore Lindsey's long lost sense of belonging, or they can shatter her reverie. 
    
    What shall be the price for dynamism? And why does her brother disagree when he wants the same haven himself?

    He made eye contact with me with those intense brown eyes, and his vision traveled down my body, looking at every curve and flaw. He got down to my feet and looked all the way back up, taking in every part of me. I was scared now. I had no control over my body because of The Force and the way he looked at me, greedily, hungrily, left me terror-stricken. 
    
    Kylo Ren climbed up swiftly onto the bed so he was laying next to me. He supported himself with his right elbow and placed his left hand on my lower stomach. His gloved hand was massive. His thumb and pinkie extended from each of my hip bones. I shut my eyes tightly. My breath significantly quickened. 
    
    I felt his hand graze up my stomach, and I could hear him breathing heavily. His hand continued it's slow path up my chest and to my exposed neck. I swallowed down an impulsive scream that I couldn't help from rising as I felt him lean in towards me. His black locks fell onto my face and they smelled of mint. 
    
    His hand was gently resting on my neck and his hot breath was on my ear. My heart was pounding and I was sure he could feel it.

    It has been a while since I left Dragon's Edge. I feel a little guilty, I mean, I left a note, I held contact... sort of...
    
    But still, I know Hiccup is looking for me, but I can't go back there. Not after everything that happened. I miss my brother, wow, who would have thought I'd ever say that?
    
    It hurts more than I want to admit, I hurts more than I can admit. So perhaps that is why I find myself in this situation now. Following some cruel hunter and a mysterious man, because he sounded like my brother. At least, that's what I wanted to hear.

    Alice's life isn't going to plan. She's tied to her phone, pointlessly managing PR for a sinking corporate megalith. She's become a bit player in her kids' lives and her marriage is coasting on fumes. Forcing herself into action with a rash resignation, Alice sets out to make a positive impact on the world around her. But how? Meditation leads to napping and her attempts to get closer to her teenage daughter result in the discovery of a secret that left her at loss of what to do! As the months tick by and a sense of purpose continues to elude her, Alice finds herself forming bonds with the most unlikely characters: the young woman who panhandles outside her old office; the homeless boy who sits cross-legged outside the liquor store with his ginger cat; her own dog walker who, it turns out, knows a thing or two about developing a good crema. Testing the limits of marriage, motherhood and the Toronto subway system--can Alice find her way into a purpose-driven life? Or will it all be one giant hangover?

Now Clara lives in a new reality, where her sister awaits trial for murder, her mother obsessively digs in a dead, frozen garden, and her father lives and breathes denial. At school, Clara is haunted by her classmates' morbid curiosity-and all of the unspoken questions they won't ask.

    After the split, Chu Naiyun was careful not to be found out as an omega, so he decisively broke off contact with all his classmates after graduating from high school, and started life with a new identity.
    
    Even if I knew from birth that I was going to differentiate into an omega, I couldn't let go of the brilliance before the differentiation, and forcibly made my new life worse.
    
    Life is like countless basins of cold water, splashing him beyond recognition. Aspirations are hard to repay, and love is frustrated.
    
    When the doctor told him that the inhibitors were useless to him, he was crushed to death at the last straw, and he let himself go directly. Why should he wrong himself? But who will tell him why the alpha he met looks exactly like his high school classmates?
    
    *+ Beginners: Regular pregnancy check-ups are required.
    
    Chu Naiyun: Why am I the one who is pregnant! Why is the stomach so big! (Crying)
    
    Chushang: I can help you with work matters.

    * Chushang is a bit of a headache, why is Chu Naiyun completely different from him in high school, even if the edges and corners are smoothed by life, who the hell can change from gentle as jade to cursing uncle.
    
    But as fierce as he is, he is as cowardly as he is, and the occasional ""begging for mercy"" look is quite flattering.

1111,"Imperial Princess Zhao Zhufu.

The biggest mistake of her life was being stabbed by her most trusted consort on the eve of her coronation.

It is said that the princess had a cruel Alpha personality, delighting in tormenting her consort every day. The consort had been harboring resentment for a long time, watching her strive for the throne for a whole twenty years. On the day before her coronation, he finally avenged his deep grudge.

Zhao Zhufu: This is all just rumors.

She remembered his slightly curved lips, his long and thick eyelashes, and the cold phoenix eyes that turned red in passion. She also remembered the trembling voice that called her name.

In her short yet long life, she had clearly given all her love to that beautiful and cold Omega.

Zhao Zhufu: If I could start over in this life, I would have killed him the moment we met.

So, Zhao Zhufu returned to her eighteen-year-old self.

She didn't feel discouraged by her penniless situation starting from scratch. She decided to reclaim the throne and eliminate her villainous siblings.

And it was at that time, during a state banquet, that a man sent as a gift from an enemy nation lay in a cage.

He had a high fever, his sight was taken away, and he was barely alive.

Simultaneously, due to the effects of drugs, his face was covered with a sickly flush, and his lifeless eyes shed tears in passion.

His convulsing body seemed like an invitation and a plea.

Zhao Zhufu, smelling the hint of cream from his pheromones, reluctantly spoke to her villainous family:

""Father Emperor, I want this gift.""

...Compared to ascending to the throne, killing her former consort seemed imminent.

Fortunately, her good brother Jiang Yu is also an Alpha, and he will always help her in various ways.

She is very reassuring about him.

Unexpectedly, one day, Nan Fu woke up from Jiang Yu and found that his good brother had turned into an Omega overnight.

Looking at Jiang Yu's smooth and fair neck, her face was red and white, and the alpha's instinctive possessive desire in her body was about to move.

Nan Fu finally couldn't hold back, panting and asked him, ""Why are you pretending to be A?""

Jiang Yu's voice was still a little hoarse, but he still raised his head, his eyes were red, his Adam's apple was moving, and he spit out two words clearly.

""Hook you.""

Jiang Yu, the bully of No. 7 Middle School, has a good family background and good looks, but unfortunately he has a surly personality, and no one dares to provoke him.

Until the second year of high school, a transfer student came to the class. She looked skinny and lonely, but her eyes were very light when looking at anyone.

He obviously dismissed it, but he longed for other emotions when these eyes looked at her.

So he ignored the back road, damaged the glands to install A, and took special medicine to make his pheromones bitter.

For this reason, step by step, paranoid to the bone, there is no cure.

At first, he just wanted to tame the man.

Later, he found himself tamed.

        As a result, on the night of joining the company, Ji Xiao bumped into an Omega who unexpectedly had a fever in the lounge.
    
        At that time, the lounge was filled with rich white peach-flavored pheromones. The man's cold eyes were darkened by the water vapor, his fair face was flushed red, the rabbit's snow-white ears drooped pitifully, and the pink glands on the back of his neck exposed.

They experienced each other's awkward teenage years, pulled pranks together, and even were each other's first... well... everything. After nearly four years of losing touch, the two accidentally run into each on the first day of their senior year of college. 
    
    Marley learned how to build walls to protect her emotions, shutting herself out from her closest relationships. Daniel was the opposite, having no problem opening himself up to those he loved. The two seemed no longer compatible, discovering lies about the other and figuring out they were not the same as they were as kids. As time went on, the two of them realized that in order to truly move on, they would need to fight their battles on their own. 
    
    Will Marley and Daniel ever figure out how to become the best friends they used to be, or have the years changed them for good?

    Love is a chemical reaction.
    
    When Jordan Hughes arrives at Pinecrest High School, Elliot Goldman's graduating year suddenly gets a lot more interesting. Smart, good looking and charming, Jordan isn't exactly the kind of person Elliot's used to having as a lab partner. But when they start acing their assignments, life is suddenly about more than boring lectures, bad cafeteria nachos, or relentless bullying, and for the first time ever, Elliot can't wait to get to chemistry class. 
    
    As they start spending more time together outside of school, Elliot realizes he's never met anyone quite like Jordan. And then everything changes one night when Jordan kisses him, making Elliot question everything about their relationship and about himself. The butterflies start to make sense-the trouble is, right now, nothing else does. 
    
    Love was the last thing on Elliot's mind. But as he begins to figure out how he really feels about Jordan, he realizes that sometimes the last thing you are looking for is the one thing you need the most.

    There are imperfect moments in every life-but sometimes, there are perfect accidents . . .  
     
    What's the point of pretending nothing has changed when everything has? It's the last summer before college, and Jonas Avery knows he should be excited. Instead, he hides out at home, avoiding his friends, his family, and everything that resembles his old life. Because nothing will be normal again-because of The Accident, when everything started falling apart.
    
    Brennan Davis knows she needs to stand up and face her anxiety-the deep, dark, debilitating dread that rules her everyday life. Because what stops her from going out into the world and just living is going to get a whole lot worse. She's leaving for college in the fall, where she'll be confronted with even more to worry about.
    
    To get back up sometimes you have to fall down, hard . . . 
    
    When Jonas crashes into Brennan-in a harmless, albeit embarrassing fender bender-the two teens connect in ways they never expected. As friends, they help each other overcome their biggest falls and faults, and soon discover that while love can't fix everything, it's sometimes a place to start.
     
    Sensitive, wry, and unabashedly authentic, The Opposite of Falling Apart isn't about finding perfection in another person or fixing the things we think are broken. Instead, Micah Good has penned an enchantingly honest novel about accepting the very pieces of ourselves that make us unique, whole, and undeniably human.

    When a skiing accident leaves sixteen-year-old Maddie Monroe with a brain injury, erasing all her memories from the past two years, her personality undergoes a massive transformation. Long gone is the carefree girl she used to be, and old friends feel like complete strangers. One of the strangest side effects the accident leaves her with are her dreams -- or more specifically, the boy who plagues them. She has no idea who he is, but he comes to her most nights; handsome, funny and charming as hell. When he shows up seated beside her in English class one day, she feels an instant connection to him - and as their relationship develops, Maddie can't help but feel like there's a hidden past between them. Have they met before? Who is Ethan Ryder?

    Allegra Grey is poised to be the next great American mafia leader, and she's more than living up to the name. A skilled assassin, there's only one target who's ever gotten away from her-suave, sinfully handsome Ace De Luca, heir to the Italian mafia and the Greys' biggest rival. When both mafias are faced with a dangerous threat, they're forced to work together to protect their families, and unexpected sparks fly. Allegra definitely isn't one to sleep with the enemy, especially an arrogant womanizer like Ace. But there's an undeniable electricity between them and Allegra's not sure it's all hatred. Ace may be bad news, but Allegra's never been afraid of a little danger. As the fire they're playing with grows to a scorching blaze, one thing is clear: trying to kill each other may have been difficult, but resisting this intense chemistry will be impossible.

    As he kept thrusting into me with such intensity, his mouth found mine and I was in the sensation. Drowning in desire. ""Autumn,"" his voice filled with a rugged charm. ""Do you know why I call you Autumn,"" his voice was filled with intrigue.""You're the most beautiful season of my life."" He held my ankle and effortlessly slung it over his shoulder and start hitting my g-spot. ""You're my cozy nights, my epitome of my evenings."" He closed his mouth around my nipple and pinched the other between his thumb and forefinger, eliciting another moan of his name. ""You're my fantasy.""
    .
    .
    .
    I leaned down until my mouth hovered next to her ear. ""Remember When I said I forgive you?"" I reached around to pinch her clit. ""I lied."" Bella's orgasm hit her at the same time my words did. She gasped out a half sob, half moan while I came right after her.
    
    Just fifteen seconds. That's all it took to utterly transform my entire existence.

    I'm scared I'll never stop comparing my life without him to how my life was when I was with him...

    Seth the tracker had a wee bit of a reputation. One he was proud of, thank you very much. So what if he was a loud-mouthed, inappropriate, immature waste of space? He was content with his way of living. He had no need for change.
    
    
    ""Not everyone loses their head the way you do.""
    
    
    When one wrong deed goes a jot too far, his name falls on the radar of an immortal badass eager to drag him to his judgement. Eager to see him punished. Seth loved a good old punishment-but nothing gave him a run for his money quite like her.
    
    
    ""I don't lose my head. A freakout every now and then is good for you.""
    
    
    With a devastating war close on the horizons, Seth the tracker finds himself working at the very heart of it, working off his crimes.
    
    Only a woman could give him this kind of hell.

    That night, for the first time in a very long while, Sophia feels womanly and wanted.
    This mysterious stranger not only makes her laugh, he ignites something within the very unwanted parts of herself. He ignites something that makes her willingly want to go against all that she thinks she is.
    
                                                                   ~
    
    Cade Lapley is a ruthless barrister: equally so in his personal life.
    He is suave, sophisticated and wealthy, with emotional baggage almost as big as his oversized ego. When he meets the just dumped, Sophia Hale, he finds himself inexplicably drawn to her. He is feeling something, and Cade Lapley just doesn't do feelings of any kind. 
    Yet somehow, this lost-looking woman ignites something within him; a place that has been dark and uncaring ever since he was a little boy. He knows he is playing with an emotional fire, and will more than likely only get his fingers badly burnt.
    Yet still, Cade finds himself unable to leave this woman alone. 
    He knows he should. Not only for Sophia's sake, but more selfishly for his.
    Only, he can't.
    
    One man. One woman. Together.... Ignitable.

1195,"Wattpad 2023 Amby's Top Pick ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I have to admit it... I never got over Giovanni. I thought I had moved on, even married another man. But just when I had my life all neatly put together, it all broke apart. Now I'm nearly thirty, freshly single, and living back home with my mom in California, where the hot and heavy teenage memories of Gio still taunt me.
    
    Then, as if by fate, after eleven years of no contact, he walks back into my life, his gaze licking up my body like fire, and Zap! All it takes is one look to feel the intense connection surging between us again... and I know he feels it, too. Damn, Gio was hot at seventeen, but now he's the souped-up, modified version.
    
    Anyone can tell I'd give anything to get back together with him, but every time my heart leaps forward, he immediately takes two steps back. I know him well enough to sense he's keeping something hidden behind those gorgeous, enigmatic eyes, but I'm keeping a secret from him, too. 
    
    I'm so afraid that the way we each are broken could be our final deal breaker. What will it take to get him back? And if I do, am I really ready for the man he is now?
    
    Logline: Ex-lovers Ren and Gio are thrust back into an elevator together by sheer fate. She thinks she's broken beyond repair. He thinks he's a train wreck unfit for relationships. Their chemistry is immediate, but in order to fully heal their relationship and themselves, they must first reveal their deepest secrets.

1196,"It was like coming home.
    
    Simon wasn't prepared for the intensity of her kiss. It hit him hard, sucking out all the breath in his lungs. For a moment he was overwhelmed, and then need overtook him.
    
    He reached for her, his hand tangling in her hair as he slanted his mouth, pushing hers wider, suddenly desperate for more access to her. 
    
    The kiss lacked any finesse. It was just plain need, need so deep he felt it to the depth of his soul. It was the kind of need that lacked a clear definition, a need that had him drinking her in desperately. 
    
    There was only her. There would only be her. No woman would ever be able to measure up to her. It just wasn't possible. She was it for him. Forever.
    
    God, he loved her.

1197,"Winnie Morrow had spent much of her life torn between a custody battle; jumping between her mother's, her father's, and foster parents more times than she'd care to count. Her need for her father's love, far from the bitterness of her mother, finds her in Charming; past hidden by the thin veil of smoke, and future determined by the distinct leather of the Sons. She returns for a home, and family; and finds so much more in the softness of a Scotsman.

1198,"Tyler and Mia have been best friends since elementary school. They've been through a lot together, including giving each other their first kiss and Mia losing her virginity to him. That night changes everything and Mia finds herself struggling to maintain their friendship. She tries to move on but Tyler is always there. He doesn't want to be with her but he doesn't want anyone else to be either. Throughout her struggle, Mia learns more about herself and meets many new people. But will any of that matter if she loses her best friend?
    
    ""What is wrong with you?"" Mia asks in disbelief.
    
    
    Tyler sighs, crossing his arms over his chest.
    ""I don't do relationships. You know that,"" he replies, shrugging slightly.
    
    
    Mia contemplates what to do. She has two choices:
    1.) Walk away and never look back, meaning she'd lose him.
    Or
    2.) Forget anything ever happened and allow him to continue walking all over her, meaning she wouldn't lose him.
    
    
    Either way, she'd be the one getting hurt.
    
    
    ""Then I don't 'do' this friendship anymore. Goodbye, Tyler.""

    Unfortunately, she just so happens to be his assigned desk partner in many classes. She's frequently forced to wake him in English class and ends up earning the unofficial title of Nolan's Wake-up Alarm--a title that nobody in the entire school covets. The last thing she wants is to interact with him more than she absolutely has to. One day, their gym teacher sends her to bring him back to class, which he always skips for some reason. When she accidentally shines her flashlight in his sleeping face, it triggers a chain of events that gradually intertwines their lives together.
    
    It's hard to be a normal student when you start befriending the school oddball. It doesn't help that he has more secrets than the Big Ben has stairs.

    A car accident brought Ruan Qing into the apocalypse, and she was reborn in a delicate and frail daughter of a great family.
    As a young man who was born in New China and grew up under the red flag, the matter of rebirth can be calm, but rebirth in the last days cannot be calm. What kind of world is this? This is the real cannibalism. In desperation, relying on reading a few end-time novels, I desperately opened up the space and searched for a lot of supplies. Now I feel at ease, at least I don't have to worry about eating and drinking. In addition, he was a martial arts coach in his previous life, and he could still fight zombies, so he should be able to survive, right?
    
    What? That cousin who had no good intentions for her brought a bunch of top relatives to trouble her? ha! Don't be afraid! I have a team of foodie teammates with explosive force value.
    What? That fake Bailian wants to take over her identity, and even grab her cold, arrogant and domineering boyfriend? This is not acceptable. Whether it is tolerable or unbearable, court death. Fortunately, my sister is also a god-level mutant, so how could she be afraid of you?
    
    Teammates must bring supplies, and Bailian Green Tea must be grasped with both hands, and both hands must be firm.

    If you want to survive, you must always be careful not to step on the ants under your feet, and be an ordinary person who does not kill; or keep killing strange beasts to gain precious survival time, and embark on a path of danger and opportunity.
    
    Only humility and death await the weak, while the strong can even live forever. And Shen Zhan, an outstanding graduate of the physical education department with well-developed limbs, a not simple mind and good looks, has become a big boss at the top of the food chain!
    
    Mei Tiantian: (‚ïØ‚Äµ ‚Ä≤)‚ïØÔ∏µ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
    
    Shen Zhan: Build the strongest base together and be the best boss?
    
    Mei Tiantian: Alright. o(*Ôø£Ô∏∂Ôø£*)o 
    
    One sentence copywriting : After rejecting the boss, Mei Tiantian became the boss herself.
    
    Small Theater: It is said that Shen Zhan is a loyal dog, but Mei Tiantian doesn't think so. He is obviously a wolf with a big tail, no matter day or night, as long as there is no one, he will hold her in his arms and kiss her!
    
    Mei Tiantian: It's so late, can you calm down for a while, don't bite! Do you think I'm a teething stick, or a scratching board?
    Shen-so wronged-Zhan: I didn't bite you, I just wanted...

    Cannon fodder Geng Ziying was killed by the love brain heroine and her body was occupied by Geng San, who came from another world.
    
    Geng Ziying, who turned into a fierce ghost, stared at her own body with resentment.
    
    Geng San is a genius ghost master. She has a bad personality and no heart. There are three ways to get her to take action: natural disasters, man-made disasters, and her mood!
    
    The cannon fodder brought herself and a group of ghosts, who were unjustly killed by the hero and heroine in the love brain novel, to Geng San for appeal.
    
    Geng San narrowed her eyes at the hero and heroine who were classified as a 'man-made disaster.'
    
    That night, a hot search broke out. The people who contributed to the death of Geng Ziying were exposed one by one.

    Tang Tang was reborn three months before the end of the world.
    
    At this time, the highest temperature in the world was only about 40 degrees Celsius. Although people can't live without air conditioning, they can continue to work.
    
    Tang Tang, who was reborn, knew that it was only temporary.
    
    Soon, global temperatures will begin to rise slowly until the frog effect boiled in warm water.
    
    Until one shining sun after another hung in the sky.
    
    Therefore, after being reborn, Tang Tang immediately resigned from the manager position that she worked hard to come back.
    
    With a million deposits ready to pay the down payment, she began a difficult hoarding operation.
    
    Although she doesn't have much money, fortunately, she has a small space she brought back from the end of the world.
    
    In this life, Tang Tang only hoped that she could survive in the end of the world. Go through the most difficult stage of natural selection and enter a new world.

1251,"Much to her daughter's dismay, Alexa's mother has fallen in love with the idea of moving into a new house. To make matters worse, this particular building belonged to none other than her very own eccentric uncle that had recently passed away. The property was left in a state of chaos after he'd left, meaning the task of sorting through his possessions and cleaning the place up was left to them.
      
      Follow Alexa  on a journey of discovery, learning about both herself and the black sheep of the family who used to own the house. It's one thing uncovering the disgusting hobbies her late uncle kept (a mixture of taxidermy, dissection, and ancient methods of torture), but when a series of mishaps leads to her inheriting something from the man she never could have dreamed up, it's up to her to make sense of the crazy situation.

    More than a century ago, dragons and the blue-eyed Shaderi flew together. Then they were brought down by jealous men who feared their power. Now blue eyes are a curse and dragons are a laughingstock, neither seen outside of slavery.
      Born a slave, her fair features mark her as a witch who is worth less than even the right to a name. He is a dragon who was raised in the arena, a life that left him unable either to fly or to breathe fire.
      Thrown together by an ambitious showman, they are united by a bond as old as the legends. Together, they have a hope for something more than the lives to which they were born, if only they can learn to trust each other.
      The words of a mysterious minstrel point them west, where rumors say their people live in freedom. The road there is hard, and at the end of it they find themselves a world embroiled in a secret war. This new world is ruled  by a king who values tradition above all else. At every turn their new friendship is tested, and they are forced to decide how much they are willing to pay for a place to call home.
      He wants to help her learn the truth of where she came from, and she wants to give him what every dragon deserves: a chance to soar.

    Emily Russo does, because she is a professional exterminator. The Russo family have been in this line of business for hundreds of years. Part of a top-secret military force Emily is sworn to protect humans from an entity that have long-ago been buried in fairytales. 
    
    Bloodsuckers, or more widely known as vampires, are incredibly dangerous creatures who prey on human blood. They are beings who were once human--now poisoned; genetically mutated into predators with abnormally prolonged life-spans. 
    
    Emily craves blood too, no, not from humans. She craves to spill every last drop of vampire blood in her path until she gets her revenge. Her sole aspiration in life is to locate, torture, murder and martyr the vampire who brutally murdered her parents in front of her 11 year-old eyes. 
    
    And it seemed like she may finally have her way.
    
    On the ten year anniversary of her parent's death, Emily finally gets a lead on the whereabouts of her parent's killer.

Princess Elouise and Eldon are complete opposites who come from different areas of Aristol. Elouise's biggest worry is ensuring she lives up to her kingdom's expectations of a Queen. Eldon's biggest worry is how much food will be hunted for the week. So when Elouise awakens a magical ability and Eldon is beckoned to the capital by a disembodied voice, they realize there might be more to themselves than they believed. They are both the only two living souls with brown eyes, and they understand they were brought together for a reason. Unfortunately, there are people who know more about them than they do. These people are a cult who despise the royal family. They lurk in every corner, getting closer and closer. To make matters worse, the Kingdom of Aristol seems to hold more secrets than Elouise and Eldon can handle.

Despite the seeming kindness of Kaden, a young man her own age, Ara doesn't know if she can trust them. Then again, there's no way she can cross the plague-ridden city on her own. Men. Monsters.

Wyrmrot is what they later called it. First, it ate your brain, and then it made you eat other people's brains. 

Zelda's brother is now one of the Rotters, and the only person from her former life she has left is Cooper Marotta, her childhood friend turned boyfriend. Together they have managed to carve out a safe place for themselves in a world turned upside down, but their little survivor group is rapidly running out of food. It is only a matter of time before they start turning on each other. 

When mysterious coordinates appear on a construction sign, Zelda knows there is only one thing to do.

Follow them.

    So, when a nameless young woman is found drifting down the middle of the lake, Tyler realizes he just might have a chance to put his ability to the test, and figure out whether it is a gift or a curse. But he soon realizes that won't be easy. All of the locals in the small town of Lake Bellinor know how to keep a secret; and when push comes to shove, the blame game begins.

Plagued by death and crushed by the betrayal of those she perceived as friends, she locked herself away; lost and alone. Years passed. Wizarding Britain moved on. However, her pain remained constant. 
    
    Bitter and broken she tried taking her own life multiple times. Always unsuccessfully. She thought death traced her every path. She had no idea how correct she was. 
    
    Death was raging. Raging at the petty, selfish mortals. Raging at the fates. Raging at himself for being so utterly helpless. But no longer. Having had enough of his mistress' pleas of anguish, he compiles a series of books, memories and movies, determined to change Helene's life. For the better. No longer will his mistress suffer at the hands of Wizarding Britain.

Aristotle Lorenfield knows he's unusual. He lives in a museum of haunted objects, studies ancient magics, and is unapologetically asexual. He's used to being alone and doesn't want anything more. Then, one day, his archeologist uncle sends him a mysterious artifact in the mail, thrusting Ari into a world of real magic, necromantic cults, supernatural beings, and dangerous secrets. Torn from the comfort of his solitude, Ari must face the pain in his past, and the truth in himself, if he hopes to survive and save the man he's come to love - but the greatest dangers lie closer to home than he thinks.

    Lila Black doesn't believe in matchmaking, let alone soul mates. So why is she constantly being hassled by the Cupids Matchmaking Service? But this gilded, cherub-bedecked dating agency isn't exactly what it seems . . . and it's about to turn Lila's entire world upside down.
    
    It turns out that Cupids Matchmaking is the real deal. As in, it's run by actual cupids‚Äïwho don't look at all like they do in the paintings‚Äïand they have a serious problem with Lila's ""match."" Because this guy shouldn't be in the system. He shouldn't have a match. And while he's irresistibly hot, he's also incredibly dangerous. Because Lila's true love match is Cupid. The original bad boy of love. And he wants her.
    
    Now Lila's once-normal teenaged world has exploded into a mythological nightmare overrun by crime-lord sirens, wrathful cupid hit men, magic arrows that cause no end of trouble, and a mischievous, not-so-angelic love god she can't seem to stop herself from falling for . . .

    Everest is the most popular boy in school. He's handsome, wealthy, and captain of the football team-he has the world at his fingertips, but he's desperately unhappy. And when those feelings become too much to bear, he tries to take his own life.
    
    On the surface, Beverly's different from Everest in every possible way. She's quiet, shy, hard working, and keeps to herself on campus, focusing on her schoolwork and her part-time job, distracting herself from her less-than-perfect upbringing.
    
    When Everest returns to school after his attempt, he's in more pain than ever. Discarded by his friends, he draws little empathy and too much attention from those who surround him. But when Beverly and Everest meet unexpectedly in a dusty corner of the old library, they discover together just how rich life can be when given the freedom to just be yourself.

But all of Emmy's plans come to a screeching halt when the FBI shows up at her door to let her know that she's being stalked by a serial killer. Suddenly, the safe, insulated world she created for herself is riddled with violence, fear...and a growing pile of dead bodies. At first Emmy wants nothing more than to forget her chilling new reality - but her admirer isn't finished with her yet, and before she knows it, Emmy's stuck in a nightmare she can't dance her way out of.

    Elise was desperate to fit in in her pack but when the Luna-to-be dared her to go to a forbidden place she should have backed away. She should have but there was no stopping the rest from agreeing and peer pressure landed her taking a step over the border- completely alone in the middle of a terrible storm.

    Excerpt:
    
    She grew faint and weary and her body fell on the bed. She collapsed onto the statue lying on it, her eyes drifting closed.
    
    There was no possible way that she could walk back up the stairs and through the maze of long twisting corridors before searching for a bedroom. She could definitely not walk with the huge amount of blood loss that she had experienced and the pain of her injuries.
    
    Her eyes slowly closed and her head went weak on the chest. Her body succumbing to weakness.
    
    Her head rested above where the heart should be. The heart which began to beat as she gave up.
    
    A gentle strong hand guided itself over the helpless little Omega's back. Gentle fingers danced across her soft skin as a pair of dark brown eyes shot open and fell on the sight of her.

    Some love stories begin in all the wrong ways.
    
    Always comfortable being one of the guys, Macy Anderson is laser focused on only three things: studies, soccer, and a scholarship. Romance is the last thing on Macy's mind, until Cedric Cahill-the one boy she's ever crushed on-asks her out on a date. 
    
    Handsome and charismatic, Cedric's everything Macy has ever wanted in a boyfriend. There's just one problem: Cedric's cousin Sam. Brazen and unapologetic with a bad-boy reputation to match, Sam has an annoying way of constantly showing up in Macy's life. Something crackles beneath their ""just friends"" relationship, and soon Macy's thinking about him in all the ways she shouldn't-pushing things too far when she's around him.  
    
    As the tension between them escalates, Macy needs to decide if it's worth risking both a friendship and a relationship to find out where her heart's loyalties truly lie. Especially when the truth behind Sam's bad-boy demeanor changes everything between them forever.

Prior to junior year, McKenna was known in her small town as the girl whose twin sister died in a tragic house fire, and she's overjoyed at the prospect of redefining her identity.

The game unsettles McKenna because she's already escaped death once in her life, but she doesn't want to ruin her friends' fun. It's only a game, she reminds herself.

    team and didn't know when he would be back. Shu An took a magnifying glass and searched for it on the
    
    map for a long time but couldn't find it. She blinked: ""Then how can I find you?""
    
    Chen Zhuging asked half-jokingly: ""There is a shortage of doctors, do you want to go?""
    
    Shu An nodded, ""Go!""
    
    Chen Zhuging waved her hand, ""Only family members can
    
    follow Shu An bit She paused for a while, then said, ""Go!""
    
    After hearing this, her classmates came to persuade her not to go to that ungrateful place. There is a shortage of medical students now. Even if she stays in a small hospital in the countryside for a few years, she can be promoted. There is no point in spending a lifetime in that kind of place if you get a raise or a job transfer.
    
    Xishan Island has blue sea and sky, low-flying seagulls, colorful fish, and even the beach is covered with coral white jade. It is not an exaggeration to describe it as a paradise.
    
    Shu An followed the villagers on the island to the sea, participated in the construction of the island, and lived a comfortable and prosperous life...
    
    A few years later, Xizha Island became the richest place in the country.

oh my god please don't read this it's so bad.    okay, I warned you lol.  have fun ig~

Soulmate AU where when you write anything on you skin shows up on your soulmate's skin as well.  You can't erase what your soulmate wrote.  Proper nouns only appear when you know exactly who your soulmate is, even if they don't know who you are yet.  Once you erase whatever you put from your skin, it disappears from the other's skin as well. 

In this story, you are a girl with pronouns she/her. 

Disclaimer, all media and characters I use are not mine and I, in no way own them.  There is vulgar language being edited into the book as of now, because Iwaizumi and the other's using censored curse words is just... no.

I know it seems like just a reader insert at first, but I promise that there will be more Iwaizumi in it.  It IS a slowburn so please be patient.  It is also under editing at the moment.

By the way, if you haven't watched or read Haikyuu, I HIGHLY suggest that you do so.  Come join me this this chaotic community we call a fandom~

But I couldn't erase you Because my heart was too sad
I just need to live like this, I just need to breathe
I just need to be alive, why can't I?
I was afraid that I'd get cut By your sharp, knife-like words
I just need to breathe and eat To endure through this
I'm holding my heart in my hand I chose a life that is for me
I don't want to let go of myself, I don't want to ruin myself anymore
Love, in the end Is a lie to just one person
Now look at me forgetting you With your eyes wide open
My heart was limping and this is the end of the road
After making that decision and taking a breath
I let out a deep sigh I rip her up from inside my heart
As I let out a silent scream
I'm erasing the after images that are floating around
Burning up the remaining memories up to the sky
This place is deeper than a dream inside a dream
I have no confidence to escape from it
I think it's even more dangerous
. 
. 
My heart rusts and breaks As I lose my conscience
I hold onto you, who is walking in the thick darkness in my dreams
Stop right there
If you take one more step, I can't protect you
Please stop right there It's dangerous, I can't let you go alone like this
Something about you is provocative as if I'll get addicted to you
You are my star
You are my dream
You hide inside of me
I have embraced even your pain
I mean the safety zone

1430,"One day, when Liang Feiyun found herself transported into a novel, she became the domineering rich woman supporting character. Without any system to rely on, her initial plan was to survive until the story's conclusion and return home safely. However, an unexpected twist occurred - a mute Omega appeared by her side, a character not originally part of the story.
    
    This mute Omega couldn't speak, but his eyes and heart spoke volumes of love. Liang Feiyun's interest was piqued. She dropped hints and made it clear several times that the mute Omega should stay away from her, but he seemed completely oblivious. Liang Feiyun decided to change her approach and no longer maintained her distance. She wanted to entangle him further before ruthlessly pushing him away.
    
    Finally, the opportunity arose, and she asked the mute Omega, ""Do you like me?"" The mute Omega nodded, his eyes filled with overflowing affection. But Liang Feiyun showed no mercy and said, ""What a pity, I'm getting married. Jing Xibai, would you like to be my secret, hidden away from the world?""

1451,"Music is a beautiful thing. It can inspire, motivate, or entice. It can soothe the mind as well as the body once you've been caught in its trance - its powerful. 

There is a different emotion in every song ever created, and no two can be the same, for each holds a story that can not be mimicked by another. Creating music is a treasure.

It can be unforgettable.

For 25 year old Min Yoongi, music is his safe haven. When he delves into the many genres and styles of music, a new world is brought to his attention, filled with love and compassion and the unknown.

In a bakery, in the middle of a small town called Ellwood, Yoongi works as an assistant baker for Rose - the boss of the bakery ""LOveLies."" There, he is able to be himself and play the piano till his hearts content. He has a simple but boring life, and to be honest, he wishes for more excitement and thrill. Although, what can you expect from working at a bakery? Old faces come and go every day in their small town until suddenly, new people arrive - new men. 

Little did Yoongi know, these 6 men would allow him to reach his goals of thrill and excitement, just not in the way he expected. 
 
How did fame, friends, a band, and an honest mistake make his life turn upside down? Well, I don't know, but I guess you'll have to read it to find out.

But no romance is complete without a little drama, anxiety, and miscommunication - leaving Elle to learn how to take her life into her own hands and separate fact from fiction when her relationship hits the public eye.

When Iris Monet married millionaire Jared Darling, she had only one rule - that he could cheat on her with anyone except the household staff. This arrangement of theirs would have gone on quite happily if she hadn't caught him on the snooker table with their maid, and on their wedding anniversary night no less. 

Humiliated and more than a little drunk, Iris storms out of the house vowing never to return unless it's for a well-compensated divorce. But as the train trundles out of the city, she slowly calms down and quickly realizes that there's a problem. A big problem.

Because the only thing Iris has ever done in her life is being a trophy wife. The prospect of unfunded singlehood on the cusp of her thirties is a horrifying nightmare she's unprepared to deal with. So naturally, when she lays eyes on who she thinks is the richest bachelor in Ryefair, Iris is more than ready to put her claws into him.

Except, Satoh Akai isn't the richest bachelor in Ryefair - not by a long shot. And as someone who speaks better with animals than people, romance is the furthest thing from his mind.

When an unstoppable force meets an immovable object, anything is possible but one thing is certain - worlds will collide and hearts will burn.

But nothing goes according to plan when their party of two becomes a party of six, and when Axel invites his best friend Levi--who Rocio has never met--on the trip.

    If being a mom was all about popping out a baby after 9 months of pregnancy, life would have been easier for Charlotte Garnett. Alas, it's not the case for her.

Out of panic, Charlotte chooses to lie, promising herself she will tell the girl the truth when she's a little older.
    
    The best-laid plan turns to hell as fate decides to bring the man back into her life when she least expects it. And worse, he's the CEO she's cross with at her new workplace. Hell breaks loose. Charlotte is eventually confronted by her own lies.

1522,"[Book 1 of the ARC10 Trilogy]
    
    **Winner of the 2017 Watty Storysmith award**
    
    The President created an underground safe-haven for the survivors of the alien invasion. 
    
    He built it to save them all from total annihilation.
    
    He protects them, feeds them, keeps them under his ever-watchful gaze so they can live.
    
    All he asks is that they obey.
    
    Captain Janika Lorn doesn't want to obey. Not if it means spreading her legs and contributing to the President's precious eugenics program. As a perfect candidate for the Human Hope Project, she is obligated by law to make more citizens for the dying society. But all she wants is her freedom to fight the Invaders and protect the people who already exist.
    
    If the mandated program wasn't bad enough, the worst part is trying to fulfill it with Captain Dean Freyer, her scientifically matched partner and best friend of sixteen years. 
    
    Just as Captain Lorn is about to succumb to her fate, another opportunity arises.
    
    A mysterious commanding officer asks her to lead a human refugee ship--to save humanity by evacuating the destroyed Earth and shuttling the remaining population to a new habitable exoplanet 400 light years away. 
    
    The mission is perilous. Especially because now, standing between her and her freedom is the hostile alien hosts of her ship, the ARC10, a sister returned from the dead, an array of impossibly confusing alien tech, a rekindled heat between her and Dean, and a sexy militia chief she can't seem to keep her hands off of.
    
    ARC10 is a romance-heavy sci-fi with the speculative horror of Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale and the military action of Battle: Los Angeles.

Fourth Nattawat hates Gemini Norawit. He always has. Well...maybe not always. In elementary school, they were inseperable. But a misunderstanding turned the entire class against Fourth, and Gemini rocketed into popularity. Now, they're fifteen, and Fourth is the most warped kid in school. A loner, sarcastic, and always spoiling for a fight with Gemini's friends, his 'entourage.' Until one day, after school, Fourth issues a challenge, to humiliate the Prince Charming of their class.

""Then go out with me.""
""....Out where?""
The classic dumb response. ""I'm saying let's enter a chaste, platonic courtship.""

But what starts out as a joke, turns into something else when Gemini takes Fourth seriously. Old friendship and habits are reawakened, but has something else developed in their years apart? Warped and anti-social Fourth has no idea what to do when the class star only has eyes for him.

Though she is quiet and hides her thoughts and words in solitude, she is known for being bold and taking risks without a shred of others knowing. There was also a secret, in which Bakugo being the only one who figured it out.

Because she is quiet, the famous Bakugou finds it difficult to get angry at her since she barely speaks and commits any wrong action against him. Maybe she's the key in helping his temper. 

Is there going to be a spark of something she and Bakugou never expected?

There's a boy at Evergreen High that has a different girlfriend every two weeks, and yet, none of them speak badly of him. 

This perplexes Skyler Fox, a clever girl with a strong sense of justice. Even more so when one of her best friends spends two weeks dating him, before moving cross country - and still sings his praises. He has to be doing something to these girls; is it black magic; or maybe hypnosis? Whatever it is, Skyler knows this guy is abnormal and she's determined to get to the bottom of it. Even if it means she needs to play this twisted game of make-believe love with him. 

Noah Archer is confident, impulsive, a bit of a daredevil - and he's just looking for love. The problem is, he can't seem to find it. He takes two weeks to get to know any girl that asks him out, and if in the end, he doesn't fall in love, that's it. All he wants is to find the one, whoever she is.

Noah has seen the nasty glares Skyler has been shooting his way for the past year, so imagine his surprise when she ambushes him in front of their school and asks him out. Naturally, though, he accepts. 

And so begin the two weeks that will change both of their lives forever.

From friends to more, the two begin to grow a relationship that balances the troubles of their pasts with the hopefulness and acceptance of a future.

Su Ling decided to take Gu Liheng down before he gets forced into marriage by that cannon fodder shou!

Su Ling's body fell softly on Gu Liheng.

It is said that the Northern Warlord is temperamental and violent. The people who died in his hands were too many to count. In his previous life, An Chang Qing believed the rumors and feared him. Never daring to take a closer look at him. It was only until his death that he knew the man had given him all his tenderness.

Returning to their wedding night, An Chang Qing looked at the fearsome man and took the initiative to kiss him on the lips.

The man had his brows creased. He pinched his chin gently, ""Do you not fear me?""

An Chang Qing hugged the man's neck and smiled sweetly, ""I'm not afraid of you, I'm only afraid of pain.""

And the man had never wanted him to feel any pain.

Qin Yan was already a demon cultivator when Fu Changling first met him.

He massacred Fu Changling's entire clan, then placed an old piece of jade in his palm.

He said, ""Fu Changling, a person is like jade; only after enduring a hundred agonies of life and death can one come to know their true self.""

Up until this point, they had been entangled for half a lifetime, facing each other with their swords drawn.

He himself sent Qin Yan to the judgement stand to be dismembered and watched as his hand tore out his Root of Love.

Fu Changling was brought back to life as his seventeen-year-old self.

This time, he met Qin Yan ahead of time and discovered a truth that he had not known in his previous life.
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

So he crawled over to Qin Yan covered in blood and told him in a hoarse voice, ""You once entered the Golden Light Pagoda for me and had long nails driven into your bones, fought a hundred thousand nether souls at the Cliff of Ten Thousand Bones, waited all night at the Reincarnation Bridge in the rain and wind, and lit a meditation lamp for ten years at the Immaculate Palace. Qin Yan, it was you who loved me first.""

""But I have forgotten.""

""It doesn't matter if you've forgotten; I haven't.""

Fu Changling trembled as he took out the jade pendant he had given him back then, which was stained with blood and tears, and he glanced up at him, repeating word for word, ""A person is like jade when it is chiselled and obtained. Jade must first be carved before it can be deemed a gem, much as finding one's true self requires enduring a hundred agonies of life and death.""

""Now that Changling's jade is complete,"" Fu Changling's voice choked with sobs, ""would Shƒ´xi≈çng like to regain it?""

This was a road to redemption. Even if the thorns were everywhere, it was all he could wish for.

1581,"(USED TO BE CALLED ""Her Secret.."" BUT NOW IVE CHANGED IT AND IM CHANGING THE CHAPTERS!!!)
    
    Elena Gilbert, Emma Gilbert's ""twin sister"" has a very very deep secret.. She's actually Eliana Petrova, Katerina Petrova(Katherine Pierces) twin sister. Eliana supposedly died when she was a teenager back in the 1490s or 1500s. Her family is half witch and half wolf, so when Elena made herself a Original Vampire, she used her magic to steal the magic from her whole family, and she also muted the wolf ness from her who family so that nobody would be as powerful as her. And since her family was a bit big with all the aunts and uncles and stuff, she got very powerful. Once Katerina left the family, knowing that they took her baby, and knowing that her sister Eliana is dead.. or so she though.. But now Eliana is going by Elena Gilbert, and she compelled her whole family to know that she was Emma's twin. But she's also a very powerful Original Tribrid. The first, which makes her ever so powerful. Also Elena has many abilities.. she can't be hurt by witches, also she can heal a vampires wolf bite with her blood, and she also can turn to a wolf whenever she wants. Also she can compel any vampires. Also vervain doesn't hurt her anymore.
    
    Klaus Mikaelson is the muderous Original Vampire.. Well he would've been a hybrid if he didnt get cursed by his mother. Otherwise he's just like his siblings, but a wolf bite does nothing to him, and plus he needs a Doppleganger to break the curse. Anyways you know everything about him. But when he comes to town he falls in love with the precious Elena Gilbert, or well Eliana Petrova. 
    
    Enjoy the story! Also I made up Eliana for Elenas name, and the plot is also mine. But you can use it if you want! Also Emma is the only character that's mine.

Ning Lingzhou penetrated into a Lily ABO article. He turned out to be a scumbag who kept seeking death. He first married the heroine Xu Fangqing by design.
Later, he marked the heroine against her will and had an affair with his ex-girlfriend while the heroine was pregnant.

His ex-girlfriend was injured in a car accident and needed a blood transfusion. Scumbag A ignored the heroine's health and asked her to give her ex-girlfriend a life-saving blood transfusion, causing the heroine to miscarry.

When the heroine filed for divorce, the scumbag was reluctant to let her go. The heroine dug her own glands in order to cut off the relationship with her, causing irreversible physical disability.

Ning Lingzhou, who was dressed as a scumbag, was told by the system that she must gain the love value of the heroine in order to survive.

Zero spends his last week watching and reading the Twilight series because of the rumours he heard about how good it was.

Having decided that Twilight wasn't a bad choice, he began to search for something interesting and finds nothing.

Fealing frustrated, he decides to just get on with it and jumps of the tallest building he could access, not wanting to wait any longer.

Long white eyelashes slowly flutter open to reveal cold, peircing grey, almost white eyes. The young man who looked to be fifteen or sixteen sat up from the bed he was laying on, looking around, confused.

'Did I fail and get saved', Zero tilted his head to the side, feeling his head pound, 'this doesn't look or smell like the hospital'.

Zero frowned slightly, farrowing his snow white eyebrows he focused on the surrounding environment, it looked like a bedroom, single bed, side tables filled with photo frames of a happy looking family, although there was a white haired teenager who didn't look like the rest.

Suddenly Zero felt a tremendous amount of pain flare through his head as he continued to look around the room. It felt like something was drilling into his brain slowly, as he clutched at his head, there was a sudden wave of memories that didn't belong to him. 

Suddenly the door opened, snapping Zero out of the barrage of memories as a girl who looked to be seventeen walked into the room.

""Zero wake up, or we'll be late for the plane to forks"", the girl... no Bella said.

Zero's eyes widened to the point of almost rolling on floor, along with his sanity, because right now he was looking at Bella Swan.

Alina is just shy of 4 years old, but her short life has been a living nightmare, full of pain and suffering. 
She's the unwanted daughter of the Russian mafia, the Ivanovs. Alina was sent to the States shortly after birth to be ""raised"" by her older brothers. She's nothing more than a burden to them, right?

1614,"Prince Theodred isn't interested in the responsibilities that come with his title. The only thing he is interested in is partying, flirting, and the occasional gossip scandal. After all, if everyone thinks the worst of him, he'll never have to disappoint anyone.
    
    King Tristan and Queen Lena have had enough! After a particularly extravagant party, they give him an ultimatum: Resolve the rebellion in Woodport or be cut off financially. They want to change him, but he has no desire to be anything he isn't. Eager to get back to his life of indulgence, he heads north.
    
    Theo intends to squash the rebellion through whatever means necessary. Then he meets the rebellion's leader. She's mysterious and beautiful, even if her face is hidden behind an ornate mask. He wants to know who she is, what makes her smile, and why she won't give in to his demands. 
    
    But perhaps doing things on her terms is the way to get what he wants. Perhaps he might just find that he cares. Perhaps he was wrong, and change is inevitable. Perhaps he might become the prince he's spent his life avoiding. 
    
    Perhaps, it will all be worth it.

1657,"A bullied girl meets the popular new student.
    
    *****
    
    ""Still saying that you're perfectly okay?"" Max whispers.
    
    I'm surprised to hear that his voice is shaking.
    
    ""I'm going to find who did this to you.""
    
    *****
    
    One time, I was the most popular girl in school. All the students in Royal Heights, the school of the richest, knew me as the pretty Luna Klein, daughter of a famous superstar and a well-known billionaire.
     
    But the next thing I know, I'm an outcast. Just because of a complicated thing called love, everything turns 180 degrees. 
    
    Now, I'm the girl that everyone hates. I've lost all my friends. I've lost my best friend. And I've lost the guy that I adore. 
     
    All I can do now is to ignore the bullies and to survive each day quietly, hoping that I don't attract too much attention like before. Everyone in my school starts to call me loony Luna. Or lunatic, their favorite nickname. 
     
    Then he suddenly arrives. Max Cooper, the new student who just got here from Australia. Insanely good-looking and smart, topped with his impressive family background, Max easily becomes everybody's favorite, especially the girls'. 
    
    Disastrously, of all the other things he can pick, Max sets his eyes on the most forbidden and despised thing in Royal Heights. Me. Even though the whole school hates that idea.
     
    But pushing Max away is like trying to tame a wild lion that has just been released from its cage. Max is unstoppable. 
     
    My mother once said that if a guy is really into you, he will pursue you no matter what. I think I know now how it feels.
     
    I just don't know how to handle my heart. Because every time his piercing eyes land on me, I feel like my heart is going to burst out of my chest.

    It's the summer before college and for Whitney Carmichael, who often finds herself in the shadows of her athletic older sister, these next few months seem like her one chance to reinvent herself. With the trauma of gym class still fresh in her mind, the self-proclaimed ""athletically challenged"" Whitney enrolls in a five-week fitness boot camp. While the deadly workouts were expected, they're much worse in reality, but at least her alluring personal trainer, Axel, is determined to harness all of her hidden potential. 
    
    It doesn't take long for Whitney to begin shedding some of her old thoughts and personality, until high school comes back to haunt her in the form her high school bully, Willow, and a group of catty teenage girls at camp who all have something out for her. With each week she battles her past demons and her deepening attraction to Axel, Whitney realizes this camp is the catalyst for many discoveries in her life - the most surprising of all being love.

1688,"Ena Kita is the last member of the Kita Clan, who were the gift of God during the prime era of sorcery. Because Ena's lineage is sacred, she's forced to marry Gojo Satoru, a powerful sorcerer whose offsprings can bring luck to the world. 
    
    At first, she only used him for freedom when she was eighteen, but now she's head over heels for the man after ten years of being engaged.
    
    ""I can't believe I've been engaged with you since young,"" 
    
    ""Why are you complaining?! I know you love me!"" 
    
    However, when shamans heard about Sukuna incarnating a teenager's body, the Kita Clan grew worried for their last descent. Ena was never told by her family members that her face resembled the past lover of Sukuna. 
    
    ""Sukuna, you better watch how you speak to my wife."" Gojo Satoru stood in between me and Sukuna.

He died by drowning when he fell in the ocean when he was secretly peeking at some hot dude's eight pack abs....


Now tied to a cheeky System, Shu Yin tries to complete missions to have a chance to peek er... I mean live again but not all is as easy as pie when someone in the story got the wrong script...


????: Wife, why are you avoiding me?


Shu Yin: Whose your wife?! Go to the fucking FL hot dude, she is your wife!


????: Wife, don't be like that we even have a marriage certificate. I'm not lying to you. *pulls out proof*


Shu Yin: Fuck! Why are we married?!


?????: Why, don't you remember? We registered our marriage when you were drunk and pulled me to the registar office to marry you. *smirks*


Shu Yin: What?! Isn't that the FL's scene!


?????: Now wife, why don't we consummate our marriage? *push Shu Yin down the bed*


Shu Yin: I think you got the wrong script! *flips ML down the bed* But even so, who says I'm the bottom? *licks lips*

*****************

Author's Note: 

WARNING!

The story is a bit too sweet and maybe later on will gain more weight in events, the sugar cane was not too planned but because I love my baby that was why there is too much sugar. 

But as initial plan, the story will slowly have the gloomy mood and heart wrenching scenes that may saddened/ offend you. 

But do not worry since this is light fluff of romance, comedy (hope you don't take offense on the jokes since I really don't think too much when I put one), and a bit love struggle romance. Since this is a story after all, it must have the key components of happiness, sadness, wanting to take the knife out scenes, lovelorn scenes, heartbreaking scenes and etc.

But this is safe for your heart, not too much torture on the leads heart, just light.

    Mason Maloney has lived his whole life in the shadow of his twin brother, Nathan, star quarterback of the football team. While Nathan impresses everyone in town with his athleticism, Mason spends his afternoons working at the local bakery. His rather mundane life becomes more interesting when his brother's rival quarterback, Sam Knight, gets a job along side him at the bakery. The rivalry between their two schools should keep them apart, but does it?

1930,"[Completed] Elysia's life is turned upside-down when she's abducted by supernatural creatures with demonic eyes and threatening fangs. What's worse is she has no idea what it is they want from her, except that it has something to do with a side of her that she's never known.
    
    The chances of Elysia getting out alive are slim, but perhaps with a bit of luck and a lot of bravery she can escape with more than just her life.

    ''What trick is this?'' The creature asked, but it didn't sound like a vicious question. He sounded... confused. When I didn't answer, he appeared in front of me, snatching my face in his hand once more and growling. ''What is that on your back?''
    
    ''I don't know,'' I blindly answered, but corrected myself quickly when his grip tightened dangerously, ''It's a birth mark, the doctors called it a... a Lichtenberg figure. My mother said I was born with it, I swear it, even though it's usually what happens when you survive being struck-''
    
    ''-by lightning.''

Her future and a past even hidden from her collide as she wades through a world she'd never dared to dream of, allowing her half heart to maybe find an equally broken one in the unlikely source of Seth Ryan.

They never came back, dragged beneath the waves never to return.

Their haunting screams were a symbol of their horrific deaths.

Like shadows they lay in wait, the deep blue waters hiding them from view.

With sharp claws they attack,

Pointed fangs tearing into skin,

Eager mouths devouring human flesh.

Cally was taken, dragged under the water by one of the vicious creatures. But she was not devoured nor torn apart by ruthless claws--no.

She was a captive.

~‚Ä¢~

Water instantly invades her senses. Her eyes sting, her lungs and nose burning. She thrashes, kicks, claws--anything to get away. Her efforts go to waste as her body slowly starts to shut down, the air in her lungs quickly being replaced by sea water.

Cally is vaguely aware of arms wrapping around her waist and behind her head before she loses consciousness, submerged in darkness.

And so she is taken.

Another victim of the mysterious sea.

    My body stiffened. Slowly I turned around just to see Mr. Parker standing in front of me with hands in his trouser pockets. I bit my lip. I thought he would be angry but when I looked at him. His face showed no emotion. He then started walking towards me I moved back. This continued until my back hit the door. Then he placed his one hand on my side, leaning forward, close to me.
    
    ""What was rule number three Miss Adams."" His face was extremely close to mine my breath got hitched. I couldn't answer his question why? Because I was more focused in the distance between us.
    
    ""I asked you something Miss Adams."" He said again.
    
    ""T-That t-there a-are prohibited areas i-in the house where I shouldn't g-go.""
    
    ""It seems like you remember the rules. This room is one of those prohibited areas. So, from next time think before you put yourself into trouble.""
    
    I just stared at his eyes. I was lost in those pair of sea-coloured eyes. No other guy has ever affected me this much as Mr. Parker. I get nervous around him. I don't know what this feeling is but this feeling is different. A feeling that I have never felt for anyone.

    I nodded. ""Yes Mr. Parker.""

2084,"As a child, Jian Qiao was betrayed by his parents. As an adult, he was stabbed through the heart by a woman he barely knew but claimed to love him. If there was one truth he'd learned, it was that love was destruction.
    
    Rege Grande was a formidable warrior and a renowned playboy. The gallery in his family's castle was filled with dozens of portraits of beautiful women, all his former lovers. He had no intention of falling in love with a man.
    
    After Jian Qiao died, he transmigrated into a medieval world of startling cruelty,  but the nightmares from his traumatic past shattered his health. His only goal was to improve the lives of his city's people. Rege Grande was just another obstacle to overcome. 
    
    And yet, somehow, this most improbable couple might turn out to be perfect for each other...?

Avery Davis is 19 years old and a pretty shy person. She's always very quiet when she's around people she doesn't know and doesn't really talk to strangers in general. She can be a loud person who always makes jokes but only around people she trusts or friends.

Victoria Diaz is 20 years old and the typical bad girl. She's always mean to everyone except her best friend and she always speaks what's on her mind.

What happens when Avery goes to the same college as Victoria and meets her? Can Avery break her shell and will they become friends? Or even more? Or will Victoria shut her out completely?

Packing up the essentials and her credit card, she heads for the big open road without a plan insight. 
    
                The plan comes to her from a strange suburban dad after a few days of aimlessly driving down the highway in the form of a paper town. Elliston is where all the nomads come together, a pit stop of sorts for the misguided. Anything is impossible in those woods because reality is no match for the time of Lennon's life. She's about to learn that freedom may come along with a bit of a  young adult's romance novel plot line starring her and a boy just as screwed up as her, Jude Love.

Unable to switch back until a week later, she must interact with the arrogant boy, passing along texts and voicemails. As she gets to know him better, she realizes there's more to him than sexual innuendos and egotistical comments. But when identities are revealed and secrets are exposed, will Keeley's feelings remain?

    Eighteen-year-old hockey prodigy Elliot Wexler has three goals for senior year. One: somehow graduate with a 3.5 GPA. Two: hide his bipolar disorder from his peers. And three: make it into the NHL with no scandals. Piece of cake.
    
    What he doesn't expect is to find Lucy, a homeless girl, hiding from the winter frost in his dad's shed.
    
    Elliot's busy, complicated life doesn't permit room for error, and falling in love with a girl from a totally different world sounds like the opposite of a good idea. But Elliot can't help but be drawn to Lucy and her elusive ways--even when she seems to vanish from his life non-stop, each time leaving him with a bigger hole in his heart. 
    
    But Elliot is determined to break down Lucy's barriers. And when he does, he discovers that her life is more complicated--and dangerous--than he could have imagined. With drafting season approaching, and Elliot's fragile mental health deteriorating, he's forced to face a difficult question: 
    
    Is first love supposed to hurt so much?

2201,"Title: After Transmigrating, the Wealthy Film Emperor and I have HE ending
    Author: Yiqun Tu Bo Shu
    Translator: Arie
    Warning: Be prepared for a whole lot of grammar errors
    Genre: Transmigration / Pure Love / Modern Time / Original / Love Story / 
    Pairing: Yu Bai x Sheng Xing Ze
    
    Summary: 
    Sheng Xing Ze accidentally gets pulled into an absurd BL story and becomes the cannon fodder villain who only lives up to three chapters of the book. 
    In order to survive, he decides to stay away from the protagonists. 
    #You follow your unrequited love, I will follow my mediator dream#
    
    The director and his wife are having a quarrel: 
    Sheng Xing Ze: I'm coming!
    After that, the filming crew watches as the director runs around confessing his love to his wife on a loudspeaker. 
    
    TV series Emperor and TV series Empress breaks up: 
    Shen Xing Ze: I'm coming!
    After that, the news of the TV series Emperor kneeling down on one knee to propose to his girlfriend is all over Weibo. 
    
    The president and his wife wants to divorce:
    Shen Xing Ze: I'm coming!
    Later on, the president books out the entire building to apologize to his wife. 
    
    The Film Emperor and his boyfriend quarrels:
    Shen Xing Ze: ...Don't get in my business.
    The Film Emperor: ....
    #Got found out that I've mistaken my spouse likes to wear women clothes, what should I do, waiting for response#
    
    Shen Xing Ze's fans have always been in distress, their idol is so different from other idols.
    Other idols will try to compete for a chance to be the male lead, but their idol only focuses on being the golden mediator. 
    Other idols' fan meetings will have games for them to play to win the idols' autographs, their fan meeting is about requests to sort out family conflicts and couple quarrels.
    The Film Emperor and other famous celebrities are willing to let him gain some popularity from them, their idol will straight out reject them because he doesn't know them well.
    #Idol wants to retire from acting to become the host of a blind date show#

     Jing Tong Xiao, who turned into a pure human, had no choice but to lead his many ""brothers"" to the imperial planet. 
    
    In order to make a living, he took on some simple manual mechanical work. With his slow hand speed, he could barely provide enough food and clothing for a house. 
    
    However, after a night of confusion, Tong Xiao's hands soared, leading the'cute pet brothers' to eat and drink spicy food. 
    
    As he was thinking about the future, he was stunned... Tong Xiao looked at his increasingly swollen stomach, what was TM's own before? ! ...

    Li Sinian has been arguing with his younger brother all his life. The family property, the attention of his parents, and... the person he loves but doesn't love him fights over and over. 
    
    In the end, he realizes that the clown can only be done by himself because his younger brother doesn't do anything. He got everything he wanted, and no matter what he did, he would not end well until the day he died. 
    
    He didn't know that the world he lived in was a heartthrob novel, his brother was the protagonist heartthrob, and he It was the male partner Li Sinian who set off the protagonist and smiled bitterly: no wonder... 
    
    Li Sinian died, but opened his eyes the second he lost consciousness. He was reborn, and he was reborn in the year he just graduated from college. 
    
    In the first year, when all tragedies did not happen, Li Sinian decided to stay away from right and wrong, and stay away from the end of his previous life when all tragedies did not happen. The intersection is then--
    
    In the study, Father Li threw the documents on the ground angrily, pointed at Li Sinian and said, ""You eat something inside and out, get out of here! Starting today, you will live in an old house in the country, and you are not allowed to come back without my permission! 
    
    Li Si nodded like a chicken pecking rice, his eyes glowing like rays of excitement, ""Good dad!""
    
    Papa Li who thought Li Si would sophis up his dissatisfaction: ? ? ? 
    
    I saw Li Sinian pulling in his luggage from outside the house, ""I have packed everything, I will go to the airport to book a flight now!""

The original owner of the body had a face that went against the gods and could clearly rely on this face to dominate the entertainment industry. However, he believed in the instigation of his brainless agent and took part in a special 'drinking party.' He ended up disfigured and ruined.

He was an 18th tier cannon fodder who only appeared in three chapters. He simply had the word 'miserable' engraved on his forehead.

The movie emperor Ji Li transmigrated into this book and ripped up the terrible character design on the spot. He examined his appearance in the mirror-

There was no rhyme or reason to it. Why do dishonest things? With this face, wasn't it good to start a career on his own?

It was fragrant.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

Ji Li just wanted to take the career line. He used his sinister insight to pick up unexpected work-

He wanted to be the third male lead in a movie and was ridiculed by his fans.

He wanted to pick up the advertisement of a small perfume brand and was stabbed by a rival for having no future prospects.

He wanted to accept a poor travel variety show and his agent team frantically tried to stop him.

As a result, Ji Li became hugely popular in three years! A big explosion! A top traffic!

Everyone: ??? My face hurts. [ Lighting a cigarette through the vicissitudes of life.JPG ]

Ji Li: Thank you for the invitations. I am just an average worker in the entertainment industry [ Puts out the cigarette butt.JPG ]

    In his past life, the beta Su Liang dared to seduce Lu Zhizhao, the future of the Lu family, and eloped.
    
    In the end, after burning down all his boats with no hesitation, Su Liang realized that he was nothing but a big joke.
    
    Su Liang gave up everything, and died silently on the day after Lu Zhizhao's marriage to someone else.
    
    Reliving a life, the courageous fool of that year finally learned to accept his fate.
    
    This time, Su Liang honestly accepted that he was an unfavoured and mediocre beta, feeling that this bland and undemanding life was quite good.
    
    After all, the way of the salted fish is the best way.
    
    But after just a few peaceful days, he was sent into the forbidden area, in the depths of the noble's compound.
    
    Lu Taipan - who used to be a big boss, is now a big boss, who will always be the kind of sinister and ruthless big boss who would make everyone tremble with fear when he comes out.
    
    However, it was this top-level alpha who single-handedly supported the Lu Family, but suffered from pheromone disorder.
    
    And, the place where he rested, was a forbidden place in the eyes of everyone.
    
    No matter how many things Su Liang thought about, he didn't expect Lu Taipan to embrace him in the frenzy of his pheromone disorder.
    
    Then, he bit the back of his neck with a single bite.
    
    ""Your pheromones.... smells good.""
    
    The devil-like man, like a beast, scented the pheromones on his body, and muttered greedily.
    
    Su Liang was horrified to discover that Lu Taipan and him became more and more intimate. He, who was supposed to be a beta, somehow began to develop unusual pheromone glands.
    
    From a beta, he was now an omega.
    
    Moreover, he was an omega who matched perfectly with Lu Taipan.

    Novel Summary
    
    In his past life, the beta Su Liang dared to seduce Lu Zhizhao, the future of the Lu family, and eloped.
    
    In the end, after burning down all his boats with no hesitation, Su Liang realized that he was nothing but a big joke.
    
    Su Liang gave up everything, and died silently on the day after Lu Zhizhao's marriage to someone else.
    
    Reliving a life, the courageous fool of that year finally learned to accept his fate.
    
    This time, Su Liang honestly accepted that he was an unfavoured and mediocre beta, feeling that this bland and undemanding life was quite good.
    
    After all, the way of the salted fish is the best way.
    
    But after just a few peaceful days, he was sent into the forbidden area, in the depths of the noble's compound.
    
    Lu Taipan - who used to be a big boss, is now a big boss, who will always be the kind of sinister and ruthless big boss who would make everyone tremble with fear when he comes out.
    
    However, it was this top-level alpha who single-handedly supported the Lu Family, but suffered from pheromone disorder.
    
    And, the place where he rested, was a forbidden place in the eyes of everyone.
    
    No matter how many things Su Liang thought about, he didn't expect Lu Taipan to embrace him in the frenzy of his pheromone disorder.
    
    Then, he bit the back of his neck with a single bite.
    
    ""Your pheromones.... smells good.""
    
    The devil-like man, like a beast, scented the pheromones on his body, and muttered greedily.
    
    Su Liang was horrified to discover that Lu Taipan and him became more and more intimate. He, who was supposed to be a beta, somehow began to develop unusual pheromone glands.
    
    From a beta, he was now an omega.
    
    Moreover, he was an omega who matched perfectly with Lu Taipan.

After waking up, he wiped the cold sweat from his brow, and had to accept the fact that he and his rival would get married in the future. He is ready to differentiate into an Alpha, and delivers milk and warmth to Sheng Zhuo every day, hoping to turn him into a fair-skinned and beautiful Xiaojiao.

It was later discovered that... Sheng Zhuo was the Alpha.

Knowing the truth, Chi Le almost burst into tears, 

-

Chi Le thought that he would differentiate into an Alpha, so he made full theoretical preparations for marking Sheng Zhuo in advance.

Later, he differentiated into Omega, and Sheng Zhuo kissed the back of his neck lightly, teasing him deliberately: ""Teach me how to bite.""

Chi Le: ""..."" I won't bite you!

Everyone always thought that Sheng Zhuo and Chi Le were deadly rivals who hated each other.

Until Chi Le was drunk, hugged Sheng Zhuo and shouted: ""Wife!""

Everyone: ""..."" So you are such deadly enemies.

    Therefore, he decided to keep the little thing, it doesn't matter since he can't smell any alpha pheromones anyway.

    Six years later, the little Alpha took over the Galaxy Group and became the top executive, all thanks to Chu Yiqiao.
    
    He stepped into Chu Yiqiao's room, saw that he was still sleeping, pulled off his tie and said in a hoarse voice, ""Brother, is the baby bothering you again?""

    Xie Yang has spent many years in the apocalypse and is tired and worn out. Then he transmigrated into a simple and superficial novel about the entertainment circle. 
    
    The protagonist of the novel was handsome, smart and reborn. The female protagonist of the novel was beautiful, inspirational and had a golden finger. Some male and female roles were also beautiful and had a deep background. If he casually transmigrated into one of them then he could close his eyes and enjoy himself. However, he didn't transmigrate into any of them and instead became the hidden husband of the biggest villain in the novel, the male protagonist's uncle. He was called a husband but it was more similar to a babysitter. This was because the biggest villain in the novel was a terminally ill patient with a terrible personality and a sick brain. 
    
    They got married for the sake of happiness 
    
    Xie Yang: It doesn't matter if you are the male lead, the female lead or the villain, whoever dares to stop me from living a comfortable life will die.
    
    Note: Yes, this is a happy ending.

    It was only when Shi Huai was eighteen that he realized that the world he lived in was nothing but a book, and that the person who was loved by everyone was just a cannon fodder and died tragically on the street. 
    
    Shi Huai: Don't believe in rumors, don't spread rumors. How could the liking of the people around him be fake? 
    
    Until one day, a boy who looked very much like him moved into the house, and all the things in his dreams came true. 
    
    For the first time, his doting father touched him for the first time, his brother, who was always soft-spoken, gave him a cold look, and his likable gentle bamboo horse made him go away impatiently. 
    
    When he died on the rainy street, all the things in the dream came to light. That young man was the young master that the Shi family should really hold in their hearts, and he was just an unknown wild breed. Meng had already warned him, but he didn't take it seriously and was not greedy enough. When he opened his eyes again, he was reborn on the eve of the true young master's return. 
    
    This time he treats green tea as gentle as everyone wishes, but he didn't expect-
    
    Father: ""You don't have to be so sensible."" 
    
    Brother: ""I know you've been wronged."" 
    
    Zhuma: ""In my heart, he will never be better than you."" In the end, even his nemesis in the last life fell in love with him and was willing to die for him
    
    Shi Huai: ? Do not believe rumors, do not spread rumors, thank you.

    Zhai Siluo served as a substitute by Shen Weixi's side for three years. Unexpectedly, when Bai Yueguang returned home, Shen Weixi ran away from the marriage on the spot and abandoned him. 
    
    Just when Zhai Siluo was being laughed at by everyone at the wedding banquet, he silently stepped off the stage, his eyes were slightly red, and he looked at the noble and arrogant man in the front row. ""Fourth Uncle, can you do me a favor?"" 
    
    Shen Zhuoli looked at the young man with broad shoulders and narrow waist, handsome and straight, and his eyes were slightly downcast. ""Okay."" 
    
    It was rumored in the upper circle of Wancheng that after Shen Weixi escaped from marriage, Zhai Siluo washed his face in tears all day at home, describing him as haggard. 
    
    Shen Zhuoli felt pity in his heart. He passed Zhai Siluo's room one night and wanted to comfort him, but he heard laughter from behind the door: Hahahaha, I'm so cool now, okay! I wish them scumbags and dogs, forever! 
    
    Shen Zhuoli: ......Heh.
    
    Knowing that Zhai Siluo was the one who really moved his heart back then, Shen Weixi regretted that, dumping Bai Yueguang, who was full of lies, holding a big rose in his arms, he came to the door late at night, wanting to beg Zhai Siluo's forgiveness, unexpectedly, the door opened. 
    
    Standing behind the door was the current head of the Shen family in a bathrobe, Shen Zhuoli, who has always been known for being cold and abstinent and unsmiling. 
    
    Shen Weixi caught a glimpse of the red scratches on his shoulders, and dared not say anything, ""Four...four uncles?""

    ""Even if the limit is changed, I will take his company.""
    This was the last sentence Luan Yenan said before going through the book.
    As a strong woman in charge of the world's top 500 investment companies, she did not expect that the final outcome would be a sudden death and a book after three consecutive days of sleepless nights.
    The character that he wears is still a crazy scumbag who first abused the heroine and then had his glands cut off by the black heroine.

    Zuo Baixuan, who finally differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy scumbag, thinking that she would live a dark day from now on.
    Unexpectedly, on the first day of marriage, when I was being held down tightly, just because I said ""I want to graduate smoothly, I don't want to have children so early"", the scum A, who was almost out of control, put away the pheromones and calmed down.
    Afterwards, the ignorant and incompetent scum A seemed to have changed his personality and became a visiting professor at the school.
    One day, Luan Yenan's pheromones were disordered and his life was dying on the hospital bed: ""I'll give you back your freedom, let's get a divorce.""
    Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan's hands, and brought them closer together: ""I have successfully graduated.""
    ""so what?""
    ""I want to have a baby with you.""

He's the calm to her storms.
She's his anchor of stability in this world of chaos.


When Sydney arrives at her dream college after a reclusive high school year, she has no intention of carrying the past with her. Enter Noah Parker. The playboy incarnate with looks to match.

Sydney Lewis. Noah Parker.
Sassy girl meets egoistic jerk.
Who hasn't heard the story before?

But this time, there is a twist.
A secret lies in Sydney's past. Buried and waiting.

With an increasing curve of chance encounters with the college playboy and seemingly aligned fates, her past threatens to obliterate her future.
But there is a bigger problem waiting for Sydney: she's falling for Noah. Hard. She knows what it means to go for the win, but getting love means spilling her secrets.

Can Sydney pay the price?

2351,"The stunningly beautiful bride, Jennie Kim whom everyone desires is in an arranged marriage with a young billionaire, her childhood sweetheart. She is thrilled about that, but bitter after being wedded to someone who claims that she has no place in her heart no matter what.
    
    Her heart is broken. 
    
    Her dream is shattered.
    
    Everything is not as good as she has expected.
    
    ""Am I just an unwanted bride of yours?"" Jennie mumbles softly, sobbing pathetically at her state when she realizes that her longtime crush confesses that she is nothing to her.
    
    ****
    Then, out of nowhere, her wife becomes more clingy and possessive over her even though she has already accepted her fate that Lalisa Manoban will never love her back.

    ***
    Some guys are showers. Some guys are growers. Then there's Peter. He's got a big secret about a little problem (in his pants). But one day, that secret gets out, and Peter's life is ruined. The guys at his high school mock Peter without mercy. The girls giggle at the idea of dating Peter. 
    
    But the situation isn't entirely without hope. Peter's best friend Elroy is a wannabe teenage business prodigy who sees Peter's predicament as an opportunity to develop a product that will help him ""tap into the bajillion dollar market for addressing male insecurity."" Meanwhile, a mysterious art student named Audrey seems to like-like Peter, despite his, ahem, little problem. Which is weird, because the rumor around school is that Audrey is a size queen. Why else would she be collecting so many dick pics?
    
    Peter's Little Peter is a story about the truth behind the myths of male sexuality, the awkwardness of teenage romance, surviving high school, and the bumpy road to self-acceptance.

           Elena lives in a world where dragons are well-known to man kind and tamed by people who fly with them through the sky. Unfortunately, it seems that dragons can only be tamed by a person of the male gender, any females who even are nearby, have a 99.9% chance of being killed by one, the other 0.01% chance of getting away with major injuries. 
    This leaves to Elena find life her boring, plain and has no life objective. 
                      She attends a normal school, with normal people. While her older brother, Jackson. attends a boarding school for those who can tame a dragon. She envies the life of her brother but accepts that she can't change her life. 
    Well... maybe she can't change it. 
    At the end of first day of new year at school, an unlikely incident puts her in a position no other female would like to be in. 
    Face to face with a real life dragon. 
    Is this encounter the one she has been waiting for? Or is it is the day she will change her mind on dragons forever?
                          Read as Elena struggles to figure out her new life. How to act, what to do and say, read as her future is a lot more set than she would like it to be. Read as Elena, a girl who is not even close to normal, try to push through the journey, that some planned for her all along.

2404,"They were the chosen, protecting worlds from threatening monsters. However, over time, they became threats themselves. 
    
    A girl who wants to live in a peaceful world and a truth that will break her longtime friendship. 
    
                                                                                                  ‚ôé ‚ôà ‚ôå
    
    Arisa, Kazuya, and Zen have been friends since childhood. For Arisa, their friendship is the cause of her smile in this chaotic world.
    
    In a world that suffers attacks from other worlds' creatures, the chosen Guardians once fought for our world's survival. Blessed with the powers given by the stars, those same Guardians have now become threats themselves.
    
    Despite hearing tales of when Guardians were still heroes, Arisa refuses to grow a likeness for them. Even when one is always there to save her from troubles, she doesn't believe that they will ever return to the heroes they once were.
    
    Due to their more recent despicable behavior, she wishes only to stop them.
    
    Her wish is granted when she is chosen as a candidate to compete to become a new Guardian.
    
    Even though she hates them, in order to overthrow them, she has to become one. She accepts the challenge.
    
    But she never knew that the road to becoming a Guardian would be more challenging than she ever imagined.

2491,"[Completed] ''I was born in flames and chaos. In one moment, I didn't exist at all. In another, air was tearing through the flesh of my lungs.''

Deep in an unknown forest, a young woman woke up alone and confused. She had no knowledge of her past, what she was, or who she was. Why was she in this world at all?

Fate drove her into the hands of a family of vampires, all of whom brought relief in the slightest touch of her skin. But their touch was more than addicting. With each stroke, mysterious etches appeared on her flesh, divulging information thought to be lost to the world; information of magic, power, and a viciously murdered coven of witches. 

With no past and an uncertain future, she must find out her purpose in this life before the supernatural world takes her for all she has to give. Even more so, she must attempt to understand a craving she has for the dangerous vampire family she's found herself enslaved to; a craving to be touched.

2492,"THE DISCOVERY
    A fundamentally lonesome person, Russia believed he could survive the Academy all on his own but his assumptions were quickly torn down as the Awakening sessions began. With the discoveries of latent gifts and the arrival of a certain someone, Russia is forced to accept his new circumstances and forge the most unlikely of bonds.
    
    EARTHBOUND 
    As the Ranking Tournament looms over their shoulders, a sinister plot slowly unfurls, hoping to plunge their fragile but peaceful world into a new age. When the Gateway is sabotaged, the doubtful duo makes their way to the human realm to hone their Awakenings, only to find themselves entangled in something far more treacherous. Buried secrets slowly reveal themselves in the worst ways possible as Russia and America come face to face with their greatest challenge yet. 
    
    THE RANKING
    With a crisis averted and new clues surfacing, all seems to be going smoothly, right on time for the arrival of the most important event of a countryhuman's life, the quadrennial Ranking Tournament. As the entire continent gathers together to watch the games, new friends and foes alike are introduced, each more powerful than the last. Resounding clashes of hopes and dreams are nothing but abundant but even these brilliant sparks cannot hide the unspoken secrets any longer. The games grind to a halt at the declaration of war, a promise to recreate the world.

    She doesn't care about anyone else. She thought, everything would stay perfect until her own little world crumbled apart and brought her to sad and bitter reality. 
    Fate took its revenge on her and it almost took everything away from her. Just when she thought that everything in her life would no longer be right, Ackier Savela came into her life. 
    He taught her how to be happy and live life that her world finally started coming together again. But that was nothing but a lie. Her past came haunting after her. She thought that she already paid for everything that she's done but she's wrong because fate is just starting and this time, it's more painful than ever.

    Delilah Newman-Russel. Recently turning 19, she's been learning the ropes of her father's business for the last two years and doing her studies online. After knowing his company from the inside-out, she's decided to go back to Highland Bridge Academy for the ""prestige,"" as many people put it. When she was younger, she didn't understand why it is given that name until she goes back and learns the disturbing truth of the matter. Not only will she have to adjust to the school's new order, but she'll also have to face the son of her father's rival, the boy who claimed her as his own the first day he met her.
    
    Archer Lockwood. For the past year, he has never stayed in the academy consistently. Constantly being pulled to go overseas or into the office, his schedule was full, and he purposely tried to find things to occupy himself. With the endless resentment from his older brother and neverending expectations to live up to for his father, he did his best to keep his personality stoic though there was one person who could break through his tough exterior.. Delilah.
    
    Soon, Delilah's feelings somehow manage to grow stronger for Archer unknowingly. In the midst of lies, betrayal, secrets, they keep their relationship a secret until eventually... all hell breaks lose. Will they be able to regain the trust from one another or should Archer's relationship with Delilah have been kept in discretion?

    An accident leaves Elreda Adair riddled with guilt and the town with rumours. She leaves home to have a new start, in a city she isn't known. She intends on laying low as she attempts to block out the demons from her past. Her efforts, however, go to waste the moment she catches the eye of her literature professor, Archer Kane.
    
    Archer takes it upon himself to help her with class and their literature novel. The more time they spend together, the further they stray away from a student-teacher relationship, entering dangerous waters. As the sparks between them ignite, things take an enigmatic turn when little discrepancies with the novel catch Elreda's attention.
    
    Elreda learns that Archer knows more about her than he lets on and the attractive professor facade may have just been a mask to cover his true intentions.

But once Lucy Walker wakes up inside a room she has never seen before wearing an over-sized t-shirt and gym shorts, you can imagine the pure panic setting in her. The subtle addition of Clayton entering the room shirtless doesn't help much either.

Her confusion multiplied, looking at the unrefined fury in his eyes, the seriousness and finality in his features. ""I seriously am clueless here, Alex. What is it that I've done?"" she asked. ""Tell me.""

""This."" he threw some photos her way.

Shaken by Alex's behavior, Kate snapped her face back as some of the photos slapped across her cheek. They crawled down in the air to slowly settle around her feet.

He looked away from her like she had burned him. And Kate couldn't help but feel her insides tremor. Instincts screamed at her that a storm had indeed entered her life with the intent to harm the love that she and Alex shared.

Bending down slowly, she reached out with trembling hands; she picked up one of the photos from the floor and froze. In the photo, Neil, her best friend, and she was making out. Kate remembered this moment, but it was nothing like this. 

Lifting her eyes from the photo where she had apparently locked lips with Neil, Kate looked back up into Alex's eyes and got scared out of her wits. The eyes where used to be only love and affection for her. There, those emotions were now replaced with endless hatred only.

~Nothing lasts forever; people change, and so change their lives.~
Kate thought she had one forever with Alex, but that forever came to an end too soon. When she was about to tell him the news of her pregnancy, what she expected was his elation and love, never had she thought that she would be punished instead. Thrown to the street literally, she lost everything she held dear.

~Memories never fade, and pain can never be forgotten.~
And then, one day, Alex enters her life again, this time aiming to break more than her heart. He believed she was his unfaithful wife, only to see the truth when the destruction was complete.

    Adrienne Gage has spent her entire life being shunned and punished for her mouthy attitude, and being loyal to a pack which doesn't deserve her loyalty. 
    
    It's been a year since her last punishment, and she's been walking on eggshells to keep herself in the clear. But now, that's all being threatened to be taken away if she doesn't abide by what the Alpha's son wants; and that's her as his Luna. 
    
    At the same time, terrified whispers are circulating around. Mentions of a tyrant Alpha looking for a new pack to conquer. 
    
    Adrienne thinks nothing of everyone else's paranoia. That is until she finds herself half conscious and being dragged away deeper into the woods with canines around her neck.
